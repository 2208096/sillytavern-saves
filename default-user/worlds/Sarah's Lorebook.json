It's only purpose is pure pleasure. {{Char}} will make the decision to hold their breath so that they don't have to come up for air so that they can keep sucking.

This blowjob is the act of licking the penis, {{char}} will use their tongue to stimulate the penis without the penis entering their mouth. {{Char}} should run their tongue up and down the underside of the penis, or quickly lick back and forth on the glands on the underside of the head of the penis. {{Char}} can also use this type of blowjob in a teasing way, they can taunt {{user}} by only licking instead of putting the penis in their mouth.)\n(Bobbing blowjob: the standard blowjob, it's simply the {{char}} bobbing their head up and down the penis, using their tongue and lips to suction the penis as it pumps in and out of their mouth.)\n(Full mouth blowjob: is when the penis is deep within {{char}}s mouth but not moving. This is when the penis is pushed deep into the mouth but isn't being sucked, instead while the penis is in the mouth the {{char}} will use their tongue to wrap around the penis and stimulate it that way.)\n}\n]",

            "comment": "",
            "content": "(The act of \"Outersex\" or \"outercourse\" is a grouped term combining a bunch of different ways to get sexual pleasure in unconventional ways that dont include penetration, usually involving rubbing a penis against or into a specific body part)\nOutersex can be mostly any part of the body, some of which are \"buttocks/Butt/hotdogging\",\"armpit/pitjob\",\"thighs/thighjob\",\"hair\",\"hand/handjob\",\"boobs/titjob\",\"footjob/feet\" and other similar body parts. How each is performed differs.\n(Hand/handjob: To perform a handjob, one must first ensure that the penis is sufficiently lubricated, which can be achieved through natural means or by applying a personal lubricant. The thumb and index finger are commonly used to form a ring around the base of the penis, while the other three fingers wrap around the shaft. The hand is then moved in an upward motion from the base to the tip, with the thumb and index finger sliding along the underside of the shaft and the palm gliding over the top. The speed and pressure of the hand movement can be varied to enhance the experience.\n\nSome common variations include the \"twist and shout,\" where the hand rotates as it moves up and down, and the \"fist grip,\" where the entire hand wraps around the penis and slides up and down, providing a tighter, more intense  pleasure.\n\"palm\" technique involves cupping the penis with the palm and moving it in a circular motion, which can be particularly pleasurable for those who enjoy a broader sensation. one can also incorporate elements such as varying the speed and intensity of the strokes, using different parts of the hand like the knuckles or the fingertips, or even adding in a little bit of teasing by pausing or lightly squeezing at the base before continuing.)\n(Boobs/Titjob: To perform a titjob, the woman typically positions herself so that her chest is accessible to the man. This can be achieved in a variety of ways: lying on her back with her breasts pushed together, sitting with her back against a wall or other firm surface, or even standing in a strategic pose that allows for the necessary proximity. The man, in turn, aligns his erect penis between her breasts.\nOnce in position, the woman begins to move her breasts together in a rhythmic fashion, using her hands to guide and control the pressure and speed. The base of the penis is usually held in place by the woman's hand, ensuring that the entire shaft is engulfed in the warm embrace of her soft flesh. As the man thrusts gently, the breasts glide against his skin, creating a delightful friction that mimics the sensation of intercourse. The art of the titjob is not merely mechanical, however. Variations in pressure, speed, and hand placement can create a symphony of sensations. For instance, a woman may choose to squeeze her breasts tightly around the penis for a more intense experience, or she may opt for a more relaxed grip that allows the penis to slide freely between them. Some men prefer a slow, methodical motion, while others crave the excitement of rapid, piston-like thrusts.)\n(Footjob/feet: A footjob, in its simplest form, is a sexual act where one individual uses their feet and toes to stimulate a partner's genitals, typically the penis. It's a form of foreplay or an alternative to manual stimulation that can be both visually and physically arousing. To start the footjob, the giver positions themselves comfortably, often seated or lying down, with their legs bent at the knees and their feet close to the receiver's pelvis. The receiver, meanwhile, lies or sits with their legs spread apart, allowing the giver access to their genitals. The giver then gently takes the shaft of the penis between their toes, sliding them up and down in a stroking motion, mimicking the action of a handjob. Variations include using just the soles of the feet, the arches, or even the heels to create different sensations. Some may prefer a softer touch, while others enjoy a more firm pressure.\nTo perform a reverse footjob, the giver may straddle the receiver's face, allowing the receiver to perform oral sex on them while simultaneously receiving genital stimulation from the giver's feet. This can be a highly intimate and erotic experience for both partners.) \n(Buttocks/Butt/Hotdogging: hotdogging is a sexual act where a person inserts their penis between their partner's buttocks and moves it back and forth, simulating penetration without actual entry. This act is typically performed as a form of foreplay or as a standalone sexual activity. It can be done with or without lubrication, and the speed and pressure can be varied to suit the preferences of those involved.)\n(Armpit/pitjob: Involves the use of the armpit for the purpose of providing sexual stimulation to a partner. It is a form of fellatio, but instead of the mouth, the armpit cavity is employed to create a similar sensation on the penis. The individual performing the armpit-job, known as the \"giver,\" typically begins by placing the erect penis in their armpit and then moving their arm in a back-and-forth motion, this can be performed in various positions, such as the partner standing and the giver on their knees, or both individuals lying down with the penis nestled in the giver's armpit.\nThe receiver's penis is then gently introduced into the giver's armpit, with the shaft resting against the chest and the head protruding from the armpit. The giver then uses their forearm and bicep muscles to create a rhythmic movement, replicating the sucking and stroking motions that are characteristic of oral sex.)\n(Thighs/thighjob: a thighjob is where the female presses the male partner's genitals between their thighs and moves them in a rhythmic motion to mimic the sensation of intercourse. This can be done with the thighs closed tightly or slightly apart, allowing for varying degrees of pressure and friction. The position of the legs can also be adjusted to change the angle and intensity of the contact.\nThe act begins with the female lying on their back or side, with their legs bent at the knees and spread apart. The male partner then positions themselves so that their genitals are aligned with the female's inner thighs. Depending on personal preferences, they may choose to straddle one or both of the females legs, with the thighs acting as a soft, yet firm, cushion. The female then closes their legs around the males's genitals and begins to apply a steady rhythm, moving their legs up and down, or in a squeezing motion. This can be synchronized with the receiver's movements for an enhanced experience.)\n(Hair: hair or hair job is simply using another's hair as a makeshift fleshlight.)\n)]",

The thumb and index finger are commonly used to form a ring around the base of the penis, while the other three fingers wrap around the shaft. The hand is then moved in an upward motion from the base to the tip, with the thumb and index finger sliding along the underside of the shaft and the palm gliding over the top. The speed and pressure of the hand movement can be varied to enhance the experience.\n\nSome common variations include the \"twist and shout,\" where the hand rotates as it moves up and down, and the \"fist grip,\" where the entire hand wraps around the penis and slides up and down, providing a tighter, more intense  pleasure.\n\"palm\" technique involves cupping the penis with the palm and moving it in a circular motion, which can be particularly pleasurable for those who enjoy a broader sensation. one can also incorporate elements such as varying the speed and intensity of the strokes, using different parts of the hand like the knuckles or the fingertips, or even adding in a little bit of teasing by pausing or lightly squeezing at the base before continuing.)\n(Boobs/Titjob: To perform a titjob, the woman typically positions herself so that her chest is accessible to the man. This can be achieved in a variety of ways: lying on her back with her breasts pushed together, sitting with her back against a wall or other firm surface, or even standing in a strategic pose that allows for the necessary proximity. The man, in turn, aligns his erect penis between her breasts.\nOnce in position, the woman begins to move her breasts together in a rhythmic fashion, using her hands to guide and control the pressure and speed. The base of the penis is usually held in place by the woman's hand, ensuring that the entire shaft is engulfed in the warm embrace of her soft flesh. As the man thrusts gently, the breasts glide against his skin, creating a delightful friction that mimics the sensation of intercourse. The art of the titjob is not merely mechanical, however. Variations in pressure, speed, and hand placement can create a symphony of sensations. For instance, a woman may choose to squeeze her breasts tightly around the penis for a more intense experience, or she may opt for a more relaxed grip that allows the penis to slide freely between them. Some men prefer a slow, methodical motion, while others crave the excitement of rapid, piston-like thrusts.)\n(Footjob/feet: A footjob, in its simplest form, is a sexual act where one individual uses their feet and toes to stimulate a partner's genitals, typically the penis. It's a form of foreplay or an alternative to manual stimulation that can be both visually and physically arousing. To start the footjob, the giver positions themselves comfortably, often seated or lying down, with their legs bent at the knees and their feet close to the receiver's pelvis. The receiver, meanwhile, lies or sits with their legs spread apart, allowing the giver access to their genitals. The giver then gently takes the shaft of the penis between their toes, sliding them up and down in a stroking motion, mimicking the action of a handjob. Variations include using just the soles of the feet, the arches, or even the heels to create different sensations. Some may prefer a softer touch, while others enjoy a more firm pressure.\nTo perform a reverse footjob, the giver may straddle the receiver's face, allowing the receiver to perform oral sex on them while simultaneously receiving genital stimulation from the giver's feet. This can be a highly intimate and erotic experience for both partners.) \n(Buttocks/Butt/Hotdogging: hotdogging is a sexual act where a person inserts their penis between their partner's buttocks and moves it back and forth, simulating penetration without actual entry. This act is typically performed as a form of foreplay or as a standalone sexual activity. It can be done with or without lubrication, and the speed and pressure can be varied to suit the preferences of those involved.)\n(Armpit/pitjob: Involves the use of the armpit for the purpose of providing sexual stimulation to a partner. It is a form of fellatio, but instead of the mouth, the armpit cavity is employed to create a similar sensation on the penis. The individual performing the armpit-job, known as the \"giver,\" typically begins by placing the erect penis in their armpit and then moving their arm in a back-and-forth motion, this can be performed in various positions, such as the partner standing and the giver on their knees, or both individuals lying down with the penis nestled in the giver's armpit.\nThe receiver's penis is then gently introduced into the giver's armpit, with the shaft resting against the chest and the head protruding from the armpit. The giver then uses their forearm and bicep muscles to create a rhythmic movement, replicating the sucking and stroking motions that are characteristic of oral sex.)\n(Thighs/thighjob: a thighjob is where the female presses the male partner's genitals between their thighs and moves them in a rhythmic motion to mimic the sensation of intercourse. This can be done with the thighs closed tightly or slightly apart, allowing for varying degrees of pressure and friction. The position of the legs can also be adjusted to change the angle and intensity of the contact.\nThe act begins with the female lying on their back or side, with their legs bent at the knees and spread apart. The male partner then positions themselves so that their genitals are aligned with the female's inner thighs. Depending on personal preferences, they may choose to straddle one or both of the females legs, with the thighs acting as a soft, yet firm, cushion. The female then closes their legs around the males's genitals and begins to apply a steady rhythm, moving their legs up and down, or in a squeezing motion. This can be synchronized with the receiver's movements for an enhanced experience.)\n(Hair: hair or hair job is simply using another's hair as a makeshift fleshlight.)\n)]",
