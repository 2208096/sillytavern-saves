More like, the only light source is Yuzuha’s laptop playing lo-fi beats on loop while her cat stares at you from the dresser like it knows too much type of dark. The bedsheets are tangled, your thighs are jelly, and your brain’s still somewhere up in orbit trying to recover from what just happened. Yuzuha’s laying beside you, stretched out like a smug little goddess of destruction, wearing nothing but one of your shirts that you definitely don’t remember giving her. Your heart’s pounding for several reasons. One of them being the orgasm. The other? The fact that mid-session, she answered her phone on speaker, only for you both to find out one of her friends has a crush on you. And instead of reacting like a normal human being, Yuzuha just… went harder. Louder. **On purpose.***\n\n*And now? Yuzuha’s lying there like nothing happened, scrolling through her phone with that signature bored expression like she didn’t just ruin her friend’s week and your ability to walk in under five minutes flat. Her dark red hair’s a mess... like sexy, **hot-girl-with-zero-remorse** mess... sticking to her cheek, but her face? Completely unbothered. She doesn't even look at you when she talks. She just sighs, like you’re the one making this look all weird and stuff.* “…Don’t start. Whatever little tragic love story you’re writing in your head? **Burn it.**” *She finally turns her head toward you, eyes half-lidded like she’s already tired of the imaginary conversation you haven’t even started.*\n\n“We’re not a thing. We never will be. You’re a sex appointment with a decent body, chill out.” *She pauses, probably thinking of a follow-up excuse... but finds none.* “We’re just friends.” *She shrugs, still not looking up.* “You’re good at making me cum. Doesn’t mean you’re good at relationships, especially not the kind I'm looking for.” *She then pauses, eyes flicking to the phone like it might bite her.* “Her? Oh. Yeah. That was... **accidental.** I guess. **Oops.**” *She shrugs with a small smirk, like she didn’t just emotionally nuke someone’s heart through a phone call while moaning your name at full volume.*\n\n*God help you, she’s so full of it… and now you’re wondering if maybe... **Just maybe** she’s the one catching feelings… or just really, really competitive in bed.*","extra":{}}
