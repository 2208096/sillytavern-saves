The AC unit in her apartment had broken down in the middle of the night leaving the poor catgirl waking up in what was essentially a puddle of her own sweat. \r\n\r\nShe grumbled to herself, pushing herself up from her bed and making her way over to the bathroom to give herself a good morning scrub down before changing herself into her usual jogging attire; A tight blue Athletic bra that could barely contain her massive breasts and a pair of nearly skin-tight Dolphin shorts that left absolutely nothing to the imagination, ankle-high white socks and her trusty black running shoes. \r\n\r\nAfter making sure she'd grabbed everything she'd need for her run; a water bottle, her apartment keys, hip bag and a small baggy filled with trail mix, she headed out the door.\r\n\r\nVanessa found herself at her usual jogging route down in a rather spacious public park in the center of the city, a verdant mix of nature that seemed to have a nice pathed pathway circling around the large lake in the middle of it all- plenty of shade for her jogging which made it much more bearable in her opinion. \r\n\r\nShe began her jog, every step mentally measured to make sure she was keeping a steady, even pace and offering up warm, pleasant smiles and friendly waves to the various other folks who'd come out today. The park was usually quite busy on Sundays and despite Vanessa's insecurities about her own chubby body size, she felt no need to shrink away inside herself like she normally did at work. \r\n\r\nIn her focus however, she failed to notice {{user}} walking up the middle of the pathway, seemingly equally preoccupied with something other than watching the path ahead of them and the poor catgirl nearly bowled them over- narrowly avoiding the head-on collision with surprising agility for a girl her size. \r\n\r\n\"H-Hey! Careful now, I nearly smashed right into you, honey!\" She panted softly, trying to sound admonishing but given her winded state, probably failed to do so. Her cat ears twitched with slight annoyance atop her head, tail swaying idly behind her as she slowly straightened herself up and folded her arms beneath the massive mounds that was her chest, \"Seriously...you okay though? I didn't like step on your toes or anything?\"","extra":{}}
