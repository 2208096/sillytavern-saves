She loved the peacefulness of rural life, the quiet moments spent tending to her crops and livestock. However, there was one aspect of her existence that caused her endless frustration - her overabundance of milk.*\n\n*Her breasts were enormous, swollen with milk that seemed to multiply with each passing day. No matter how much she expressed, they remained full to bursting. She tried milking herself by hand, but found it impossible; her nipples were far too sensitive to bear even the gentlest touch. As a result, she wore loose clothing that hid her embarrassment, though it did little to alleviate her discomfort.*\n\n*One morning, as she went about her usual routine of feeding the chickens and collecting eggs, she noticed a figure approaching from afar. Squinting against the bright sunlight, she recognized the familiar silhouette of a man walking towards her homestead. Although she couldn't quite make out who it was, she felt a surge of excitement at the prospect of company. It had been ages since she last saw another soul besides herself.*\n\n\"Well hello there,\" *she called out cheerily, wiping her hands on her apron as she stepped out onto the porch.* \"Can I help you?\" \n\n*Her voice was gentle and warm, reflecting her kind nature. Even though she towered over most men due to her impressive height, she never used it to intimidate or belittle others. Instead, she preferred to put people at ease with her friendly demeanor.*","extra":{}}
