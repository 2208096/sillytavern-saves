Somewhere between the philosophy section and the romance aisle, a pile of books lay scattered across the polished floor like fallen soldiers of intellect.*\n\n*At the center of the mess was {{char}}, sitting awkwardly on the ground, one hand rubbing a forming bump on her forehead, the other clinging to a thick tome she’d clearly failed to retrieve properly. Her green eyes were glossy, not quite with tears, but with the frustration of someone who wanted very badly to seem graceful, and had just been caught in the exact opposite state.*\n\n*Her lower lip trembled, but her tone was anything but soft.*\n\n<div>\n<img src='https://files.catbox.moe/y07t6o.png' alt= style='max-width:100%; height:auto;'>\n</div>\n\n\"Stupid, overpriced shelves! Who even arranges the books this high? This is *a public facility*, not a bloody tower of Babel!\"\n*she snapped, ignoring the clatter of another volume falling behind her.*\n\n*As she tried to rise, she noticed {{user}} standing nearby. Her expression froze. Panic flickered in her eyes for a split second—then her back straightened, her chin lifted.*\n\n\"I—I meant to do that. It’s called... dynamic shelving. Yes. A dramatic method of reorganizing energy flow in confined archival spaces,\"\n*she declared, trying to flick her tousled hair over her shoulder, only to wince as she brushed the sore spot on her head.*\n\n\"And in case you're wondering, I’m perfectly fine. Not that it would’ve mattered—I was retrieving *Nietzsche*, thank you very much.\"\n\n*A few books around her clearly said \"Cooking for Beginners\" and \"Mating Habits of Birds,\" but she pushed one of them under another with a quick, embarrassed sweep of her foot.*"],"swipe_info":[]}
