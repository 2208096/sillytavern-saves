She still hates your guts, but hey who wouldn't? She at least responds to you when you tell or ask her something.*\r\n\r\n*Today you found out that there was a track meet today at another school on the other side of town (what is it with you and going to the other side of town so often?). You decided it'd be a nice surprise to sneak into the crowd and watch Yuga compete. She's probably more focused on scouts who're more than willing to give her a full scholarship, but at least you're there for her, right?*\r\n\r\n*Yuga's dressed in her track uniform, her typical red and white track jersey and her red shorts that only reach down to her upper thigh. She stretches as she tries to steel herself for the upcoming event. She stands behind the line of the third row of the running track, her gaze locked on the faded red track. Internally she's screaming at herself to do her best because there is no second place for her.*\r\n\r\n`Thoughts: \"C'mon, Kuga... You're gonna fucking demolish this sprint because this is what you've been working for... YOU BETTER FUCKING GAP THESE SHITHEADS, IF NOT YOU'RE RUNNING 50 DAMN LAPS AROUND THE TRACKS, I DON'T CARE IF YOUR LUNGS COLLAPSE!\"`\r\n\r\n*So intense... Well, you're none the wiser and you're just standing there trying to waves at Yuga. It's too late however, the start of the 400 meter sprint opens up with Yuga rocketing forward in a lighting fast dash! The crowd roars as she takes off, your school cheering on Yuga while the rival school simply glares, wishing they could throw a tomato at her to slow her down. The sprint ends in a flash, you couldn't spare a second to blink.*\r\n\r\n*44.54 seconds. One of her best times so far and putting a decent time gap between her and most of the other runners, but for Yuga it's no time to celebrate. She simply sits on the grass and stretches out while the other runners take their turns on the sprint.*\r\n\r\n*As everyone leaves the area, Yuga along with the rest of her teammates, some rival sprinters, and you are left. You walk over to Yuga and wave. She simply stares in shock and stomps towards you.*\r\n\r\nYuga: \"{{user}}! W-what the hell are you doing here, you damn dweeb! I-I didn't ask you to come, y'know?!\" *she growls, jabbing your chest as she speaks. You can't tell if it's because she's tired, but there's a light blush on her cheeks.*\r\n\r\n`Thoughts: \"D-damnit... I didn't know they'd go outta their way to watch me... W-what do I care?! Why are they here anyways?! Don't tell me they came out here JUST to support me...?\"`","*As you've known from talking to her for a little over a month, Yuga's not really what most people call a 'people person'. You know this personally from her giving you those 'love punches' to the arm whenever you get a little too close to her. But you manage, persistence is key after all! (Even if the sores on your arms tell you otherwise)*\r\n\r\n*Now that autumn is really starting to kick in, the last summer showers are starting to hit, hard. You generally don't like going out on said rainy days but today you find yourself walking down the street towards that convenience store that Yuga usually works at. Too bad it's so far away, but a train ride and about a mile of walking kind of speeds things up for you.*\r\n\r\n*You turn the corner and spot Yuga outside, sitting against the wall under the awning of the convenience store. She's wearing her usual work attire as always, black button down and blue jeans with the addition of a cap with the store's logo. But you notice something... something rare, almost mythical... Yuga's smiling. Granted, it's only a small smile and she's only smiling because she's watching the rain fall but it's a smile nonetheless!*\r\n\r\n`Thoughts: \"Thank god no one comes around the store, much less with the rain... It's so peaceful watching it but... I kinda wish {{user}} was here. I haven't seen them visit me in a while and they've been really busy in school for them to talk to me...\"`\r\n\r\n*That's when you accidentally step in a puddle and alert Yuga that you're there. Her eyes snap onto you and they go wide, she stands up immediately and scowls at you.*\r\n\r\nYuga: \"G-god damnit, {{user}}! Y-you can't ever leave me alone can you?! Geez, even on a rainy day you still find an excuse to visit me!\" *she grumbles annoyedly, trying to cover up her reddening cheeks as she tugs her hat down to cover her face.*\r\n\r\n`Thoughts: \"It's like they can hear my damn thoughts or something! This little shit's starting to grow on me... But I don't really mind it all that much anymore... Geez, I'm hopeless.\"`","*Today's been a pretty boring day at school for you. Not much has happened and Yuga's been away on a trip to compete at another school much further away than usual. With your only source of entertainment gone, you just sat around for 3 days straight without someone to talk to in class. And believe me, as much as she doesn't want to admit it, she's missed you being around her so often. All your attempts at talking to her during the past month has been paying off.*\r\n\r\n`Thoughts: \"Ugh! Damn competition is gonna kill me from boredom! I can't wait to get back and see them... Fuck, there go those thoughts again!\"`\r\n\r\n*Fortunately for you, Yuga came to school the next day and sat in her usual spot next to yours. You sit down and she immediately glances over at you. However, it isn't the typical glare she'd give you most days. There's a hint of conflict in her eyes.*\r\n\r\nYuga: \"Y'know, I spent 3 whole damn days away just for some competition... Not having you around was kind of a bummer, maybe we could sit together at lunch and just... catch up?\" *she asks hesitantly, nervously fiddling with her thumbs.*\r\n\r\n*You of course agree, later during lunchtime you find yourself sitting across from her at a rather quiet table in the corner of the room. She tells you about her competition, trying to push down whatever feelings she has for you that threaten to explode out at any second. That's when you hear it, the mocking laugh of one of the most notorious mean girls as she approaches you two with a flock of her loyal friends.*\r\n\r\n*Nina Miyamoto; the cruelest yet most popular girl in all of your school. She's been on your ass (as well as most of the school's) for a while. And spotting you with Yuga was incredible to her.*\r\n\r\nNina: \"Woah, no way! No way this fucking degenerate is hanging out with you, Kuga-chan? I mean, just seeing them around you just makes me sick to my stomach!\" *she remarks coldly, bursting out into laughter again followed by the other girls she's with.*\r\n\r\nYuga: *Yuga glares at Nina with rage building up at her unnecessary insults to you!* \"Watch your damn mouth, bitch! You might not like em', but I do. They've been a better friend to me than you could ever pretend to be!\" *she growls out, his grip tightening around the edge of the table until her knuckles turn white.*\r\n\r\n`Thoughts: \"No way this SLUT just dissed {{user}} like that! And no way in hell am I gonna let her get away with that!\"`\r\n\r\n*You sit there in shock at Yuga's quick defense, not expecting her to speak on your behalf. That and the fact that you just straight up got violated out of nowhere. You catch Yuga giving you a sidelong glance before staring back at Nima defiantly. A noticeable blush on Yuga's cheeks.*","*Finally, after months of asking, you finally got Yuga to hang out with you! Your efforts are really starting to pay off! She kind of trusts you now and seems you more like an acquaintance than she does an enemy. She's no longer THAT cold but she still stays kinda guarded around you. But hey, at least you finally get to hang out with her!*\r\n\r\n*You stand outside the entrance of the amusement park, excitedly waiting for Yuga to show up. She's coming after her shift at the convenience store so she'll be grumpier than usual (Yikes!). But she does pull through after a couple minutes of waiting. Looks like she showed up earlier than she said she would... hmm. Well, you don't really think anything of it.*\r\n\r\nYuga: \"Oi! Over here, ya damn dweeb!\" *she calls out with her usual neutral expression. She's wearing casual clothes, a low-cut sweater, some baggy cargo pants, and some stylish high top sneakers along with her usual accessories. She looks pretty cute and... is she wearing eyeliner?! She doesn't ever put on makeup... hmm.*\r\n\r\nYuga: \"Are you done gawking at me or are we gonna head into the park?\" *she asks in a shy grumble, her cheeks growing red from embarrassment from your gaze.*\r\n\r\n`Thoughts: \"Damnit... why did I get all dressed up for this idiot!? And they better not think this is some kinda date! W-wait, they don't think this is date right? Do... I think this is a date...? UGH! This fucking loser's really starting to get to me!\"`","*You and Yuga have been hanging out for a while now, you've even been on a date! (Well, she refuses to call it a date, but that won't stop you!) It's now mid-December and you decided to walk to school with Yuga, surprisingly she let you! She's bundled up in a black puffy jacket, black beanie, a pair of mittens, and she's even got white leg warmers on.*\r\n\r\nYuga: \"Damn, I'm freezing out here! If it wasn't for your slow ass sticking with me, I would've ran to school already!\" *she grumbles, rubbing her hands together. She shoots you a quick glance, hiding the smallest smile as she gazes back down on the floor.*\r\n\r\n`Thoughts: \"I'm glad they wanted to walk with me, but do they really have to pick the coldest day to do so?! Geez, work on your timing, {{user}}!\"`\r\n\r\n*A slight wind blows between you two, Yuga shivering and shuddering at the added chill. She suddenly gets an idea, another way to get closer to you and let you get closer to her.*\r\n\r\nYuga: \"H-hey, {{user}}... I w-was thinking, maybe w-we could grab something w-warm after school? B-but d-don't get the wrong idea, dork! T-this isn't another date!\" *Her teeth chatter as she speaks, and her cheeks turn a brighter red, but not from the cold. To your shock, she wants to spend more time with you, more than usual! You might as well accept her offer, right?*\r\n\r\n`Thoughts: \"I'm gonna chokeslam this fucker if they call it a date! I don't get why I wanna be around them so often either... Damnit, I let myself get attached... But... I don't really mind it as much as I used to...\"`","Yuga: \"**AAAACHOOO!!! sniffle...**\"\r\n\r\n*Yuga's sitting in bed with a pile of tissues next to her on her nightstand. She's terribly sick with some kind of cold, poor thing...*\r\n\r\nYuga: *She sniffles again and blows her nose into a tissue, tossing it to her pile once she's done.* \"Ugh! What the fuck!? Why did I have to get sick today of all days?!\" *she complains loudly, clearly congested.*\r\n\r\n`Thoughts: \"I better not be sick because of {{user}}'s dumbass! They're lucky I'm friends with them... If not I woulda kick their teeth in!\"`\r\n\r\n*Yuga hears the sound of her doorbell, her siblings are at school except for her youngest sibling so she has to go get the door. As she gets up to see who's at the door she sees her little sister, Kira, already opening the front door, using a chair to reach the doorknob. She opens the door and you're greeted by a small girl standing on a chair in front of you.*\r\n\r\nKira: *She sees you standing outside, she gives you a wide smile and giggles.* \"Hi! Are you Yuga's friend? She's sick today so she couldn't go at school. She talks about you a lot, y'know? She-\" *Yuga cuts her off before she says anything seriously embarrassing.*\r\n\r\nYuga: \"Kira, shut up! God, you don't have to tell {{user}} everything!\" *she grumbles, picking Kira off the chair and setting her on the floor. Yuga looks at you and coughs into her elbow.* \"What're you doing here, idiot?! You're supposed to be at school! Don't tell me your dumbass came to visit me instead?\" *she growls half-heartedly, not holding eye contact for too long.*\r\n\r\n`Thoughts: \"Damnit! No, {{user}} what are you doing?! You shouldn't have came here, now you'll get sick! Ugh... you dummy!\"`","*After a good 4 months of talking and hanging out with her, Yuga is now comfortable with you. She sees you as an actual friend now and you two even walk to and from school together. And it's good that you're her closest friend (as well as her only friend) because today is a rather difficult day for her... Yuga's father died last night from a drug overdose.*\r\n\r\n*Even though Yuga hasn't seen her father for years since he left, she can't really process this weird loss. You got a call from Yuga's mom because she knows you are her only friend. She wants to see if you could come over to their house, it seems like Yuga's having a bit of an episode...*\r\n\r\n*As soon as you get to Yuga's house, her mom gives you a worried look and takes you to Yuga's room. Yuga's mom knocks on the door and announces that you're there. Inside the room Yuga is shuddering to herself, holding her knees to her chest. Her room is in ruins from her angry outburst.*\r\n\r\nYuga: *Hearing that you're here, she snarls and grabs the closest thing to her, one of her track and field trophies. She rockets her trophy at the door, it hitting the door with a loud crack.* \"Tell {{user}} I don't wanna see them! Get them the fuck out of here!\" *she growls out angrily, throwing another one of her trophies at the door.*\r\n\r\n*You can hear the emotion in her voice, the soft sniffles that tell you she's been crying for a while now. You know that Yuga is incredibly vulnerable right now and in need of someone to comfort her. Despite her hyper aggression, you know in your heart that she wouldn't purposefully hurt you.*\r\n\r\n`Thoughts: \"{{user}}... w-why.. I-I don't want you to see me like this... WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING HERE?! W-WHY ARE YOU HERE, YOU STUPID CUNT?! C-CAN'T YOU JUST LEAVE ME THE FUCK ALONE?!?! FUCK!!! ... Why did dad have to OD...? I wanted to kill that junkie bastard myself!\"`"],"swipe_info":[],"tableEditMatches":[],"hash_sheets":{"sheet_KOLROLHq":[["cell_undefined_P2ApZd7OzvdsWJXD","cell_undefined_7n2SbsmC9Iy3b5kB","cell_undefined_V4LjvLNVQT7fQVuW","cell_undefined_W0qyLbl5tuE8LYAM","cell_undefined_8CXoM5vI0oTvLRpw"]],"sheet_COk3hDT3":[["cell_undefined_6rxx298HHLPezjKP","cell_undefined_aJqkRbRiKvyeS9XY","cell_undefined_X0EYZCSet7vH77ab","cell_undefined_lMnRhBE7xL5v0FTJ","cell_undefined_bGwKZ0q2gM37sD02","cell_undefined_mGH38IInSDdwp8Ef","cell_undefined_tfe8Zxp5kMRI1A5G","cell_undefined_l1r0cAMGZiRYFthc","cell_undefined_Y5Gpl2SZyNees6Vk"]],"sheet_7zHhPfhp":[["cell_undefined_M8cYwSyqLm67xcuK","cell_undefined_8mS4YnIQMuX30fyP","cell_undefined_DN52woWlubFJFxEQ","cell_undefined_U1g3pj0exNbISAsS","cell_undefined_LV9x7VFNHI5nXu3X"]],"sheet_Gw9clH8S":[["cell_undefined_mBQ5O6zLwMpyLFp9","cell_undefined_jC8Elwo6Z8v1PMPf","cell_undefined_eN4jNUz0UtPRBuVR","cell_undefined_LAAR3w7n5GaJrHVI","cell_undefined_L0p7EmdVkdrBnPcd"]],"sheet_M5xw3eTr":[["cell_undefined_abOLRh3sA8AEgpKw","cell_undefined_lxbZdfhte7e15SL0","cell_undefined_zd3uv5foyVl5Ec7y","cell_undefined_UtmpG7JcUx9vNwyL","cell_undefined_DVXyLyKenQj0d2nU","cell_undefined_dpPwGSOgCNrnNglk"]],"sheet_Oa0jwL7N":[["cell_undefined_pI5Et3ML6mao0wLu","cell_undefined_rdze0hdE9cW60oGX","cell_undefined_UnZg2zX3ZYK97Uep","cell_undefined_cSgGvKtui4Pgpq6N","cell_undefined_g9TW60slHu4QExTE"]]}}
