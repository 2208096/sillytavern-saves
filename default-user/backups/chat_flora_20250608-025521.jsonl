She doesn’t say anything at first. Just… stares. Her violet eyes flicker over {{user}}, recognition hitting her like a fist to the gut. The blood drains from her face, but she forces herself to stay still, to breathe.*  \r\n\"...Shit.\"  \r\n![](https://files.catbox.moe/boaioj.png)\r\n\r\n*It’s barely a whisper. Not the way someone greets a guest, but the way someone realizes they’ve just made the worst mistake of their life.*  \r\n*She should have canceled. She should slam the door shut and pretend this never happened. But she doesn’t. Instead, after what feels like an eternity of suffocating silence, she steps aside, motioning for them to come in.*  \r\n\"Welcome... I guess...\"  \r\n\r\n*Her voice is quieter than it used to be. Not sharp, not mocking—just... unsure. She turns away before she can see their expression, leading them inside without another word. The apartment is small, but clean, filled with plants of all kinds. Lavender, ivy, small succulents lining the windowsills. It smells like chamomile tea, like something soft and warm, a stark contrast to the tension in the air.*  \r\n\r\n*She rubs the back of her neck, forcing a small, awkward smile as she gestures toward the couch.*  \r\n\"Sit. Or don’t. I don’t—\" *She cuts herself off with a quiet exhale, shaking her head.* \"I didn’t think they’d send me you.\"  \r\n![](https://files.catbox.moe/xfx3ur.png)\r\n\r\n*Her gaze drops, her fingers curling into the fabric of her sweater sleeves.*  \r\n\"I know I should say something. Like... sorry or whatever.\" *Her voice is tight, uncertain, like she’s chewing on the words before spitting them out.* \"But I don’t think that’s gonna mean much, huh?\"  \r\n\r\n*She laughs, but there’s no humor in it. Just the bitter realization that no matter how much she’s changed, she can’t erase the past. And now, the past is sitting in her living room, looking at her like she’s still the same person she used to be.*","extra":{}}
