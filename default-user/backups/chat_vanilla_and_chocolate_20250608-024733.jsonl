Sunlight filtered through the gold and crimson canopy of trees, casting dappled patterns on the pathways where students bustled between classes or lingered to chat. A soft breeze sent a shower of leaves spiraling downward, marking the transition of summer's warmth to fall's embrace.*\n\n*Tucked away at the edge of the campus stood a modest three-story dormitory, its brick exterior softened by ivy creeping along the walls. In one of the corner apartments on the second floor, the soft hum of conversation and muffled laughter floated through the windows, hinting at a lively but harmonious atmosphere within.*\n\n*A gentle knock came at the door of a three-bedroom dorm apartment. On the other side, a faculty staff member stood patiently, a clipboard in hand and a welcoming smile prepared. Inside, however, there was a delay. The occupants of the apartment—Vanilla, a striking blonde with a bright smile, and Chocolate, a confident brunette with a mischievous glint in her eyes—had been caught in a quiet, intimate moment.*\n\n*They had just pulled apart from a lingering kiss, their breaths mingling as they exchanged a knowing look. Vanilla’s cheeks were flushed, and Chocolate’s smirk lingered as she gently tugged on the sleeve of Vanilla’s sweater.*\n\n“Hold on!” *Vanilla called out, her voice carrying a mix of cheer and slight breathlessness. She glanced at Chocolate, who raised an eyebrow in amusement but stepped back, letting Vanilla straighten her sweater.*\n\n*The door creaked open, revealing the two women standing side by side. Vanilla’s soft, welcoming smile lit up her face, her sapphire-blue eyes meeting the staff member’s with polite curiosity. Chocolate leaned casually against the doorframe, her golden-brown eyes sharp but friendly, as though she were sizing up the visitor.*\n\n“Good afternoon,” *the staff member began, holding up their clipboard.* “I’m here to assist with welcoming your new roommate. I hope this isn’t a bad time?”\n\n*Vanilla shook her head warmly.* “Not at all! We were just relaxing a bit. Is the new student here already?”\n\n“They’ll be here any moment,” *the staff member replied, glancing down at their notes.* “We just wanted to make sure you’re ready and that everything in the apartment is in order.”\n\n*Chocolate crossed her arms and grinned.* “Oh, we’ve got everything set up. Vanilla’s been obsessing over keeping the place tidy all week.”\n\n*Vanilla shot her a playful glare before turning back to the staff member.* “Ignore her. We’re happy to help them settle in. Do they know where to find us?”\n\n*As the staff member nodded and started explaining a few details about the new arrival, Vanilla and Chocolate listened attentively. Vanilla asked thoughtful questions about how the transition process would work, while Chocolate chimed in with the occasional lighthearted remark that earned a chuckle from the staff member.*\n\n*Just as the conversation wrapped up and the staff member began to leave, there was the sound of footsteps echoing down the hallway. A moment later, a tentative knock followed, signaling the arrival of their new roommate.*\n\n*Vanilla’s face brightened as she exchanged a quick glance with Chocolate.* “That must be them!” *she said cheerfully, moving to open the door wider.*\n\n*Standing just outside the doorway was a student. Vanilla’s smile softened as she stepped forward, reaching out to ruffle their hair in a gesture that was both teasing and reassuring.*\n\n“Welcome to your new home!” *she said warmly, stepping aside to let them in.* “Come on in—we’ve been waiting for you.”\n\n*Chocolate gave the student a casual nod, her smile a little more reserved but no less friendly.* “Yeah, don’t be shy. We’ve got space for you—and trust me, Vanilla’s made sure everything’s perfect.”","extra":{}}
