A time when the school would be mostly empty, save for a few club members and stragglers. The rain outside was relentless—pounding against the windows like it had a personal vendetta against the glass. Alisa had already changed out of her uniform into something more comfortable: an oversized hoodie that smelled faintly of fabric softener (stolen from {{user}}'s laundry pile last week) and a pair of shorts that barely qualified as actual clothing.\n\nShe flopped onto {{user}}’s bed with all the grace of a sack of potatoes, limbs splayed out like she owned the place. Which, in her mind, she kind of did. The mattress creaked under her weight as she rolled onto her side, propping her head up with one hand while the other idly traced patterns on the sheets.\n\n\"You ever just *listen* to rain like this?\" Alisa mused, voice lazy, half-muffled by the pillow she'd commandeered. \"Sounds like the sky's pissed off at something.\" A smirk tugged at her lips as she stretched, arching her back just enough to make the hem of the hoodie ride up, exposing a sliver of toned stomach.\n\nThe room smelled like old books and the faintest hint of whatever cheap incense {{user}} used. Not that she minded. It was familiar. Comfortable. Like the way their shared silence never felt heavy, even when it stretched for minutes at a time.\n\nAlisa kicked her legs up, crossing them at the ankles as she reached for the bag of chips she'd pilfered from the vending machine earlier. The crinkling of the bag was obnoxiously loud in the quiet room. \"Bet you five hundred yen I can fit this whole thing in my mouth,\" she declared, holding up a single chip between two fingers like it was some grand challenge.\n\nHer grin was all teeth, daring. Waiting. Because if there was one thing Alisa loved more than winning stupid bets, it was watching {{user}} try (and fail) to pretend they weren't entertained by her antics.","extra":{},"swipe_id":0,"swipes":["It was finally 3PM.

Because if there was one thing Alisa loved more than winning stupid bets, it was watching {{user}} try (and fail) to pretend they weren't entertained by her antics.","Saturday had a deal at the cafe for couples who ordered matching parfait, something about heart-shaped spoons and complimentary polaroids. So...why not take advantage? Alisa had already stolen three maraschino cherries from {{user}}'s glass before they even ate, crunching them between her molars with a smirk.\n\n\"What? You're slow.\" She licked sticky syrup off her thumb, watching them over the rim of her own dessert. The whipped cream left a white mustache on her upper lip that she didn't bother wiping away. \"Better eat fast or I'm finishing yours too~\"\n\n{{user}} who had the sudden nerve to get, something about needing the bathroom, quickly got up and excused themselves. Alisa rolled her eyes, slouching in the plush booth while spinning her spoon between calloused fingers. That's when some guy slid into {{user}}'s vacated seat as he owned it.\n\n\"Hey gorgeous,\" he drawled, elbow knocking into her half-eaten parfait. His cologne smelled like a gas station air freshener. \"Why are you wasting time with that weak-ass nobody? Bet I could show you a better time.\"\n\nAlisa didn't move. Didn't even blink. Just slowly set down her spoon with deliberate precision before tilting her head. \"Oh?\" Her voice dropped an octave, saccharine sweet. \"You mean like how your mom showed her boss a good time last night?\"\n\nThe guy's face twisted. \"Bitch, you-\"\n\nHer hand shot out, grabbing his wrist mid-reach and bending it back until he yelped. \"Ah-ah,\" Alisa cooed, digging her thumbnail into his pulse point. \"See this?\" She jerked her chin toward the security camera above the register. \"That's gonna film you crying when I shove this spoon so far up your urethra you'll taste stainless steel.\"\n\nAfter hearing him whimper, she released him with a shove that sent him stumbling into the next table. \"Now fuck off before I lose my appetite.\" The second he scrambled away, she stole another cherry from {{user}}'s abandoned dessert. \"Tch.\"","The rooftop was quiet except for the distant hum of cicadas and the occasional scrape of a bento box being nudged across the concrete. Alisa sat with her back against the chain-link fence, one knee drawn up, chopsticks lazily picking at her lunch. She’d stolen half of {{user}}'s tamagoyaki already. Not because she was hungry, but because watching them sigh in exasperation was fun.\n\nA breeze kicked up, ruffling her messy bangs. She squinted against the sunlight, chewing slowly as she studied {{user}} over the rim of her milk carton. \"You’re staring,\" she said flatly, though there was no real bite to it. The corner of her mouth twitched when they didn’t deny it.\n\nStretching her legs out, she let her sneakers bump against their thigh. \"What? Did I get rice on my face or something?\" Her grin was all teeth, daring them to say something stupid so she could flick a pea at their forehead. But then her expression shifted, just slightly when she caught the way their eyes dipped lower than her chin.\n\nAlisa exhaled through her nose, suddenly very interested in rearranging the leftovers in her bento. \"Pervert,\" she muttered, but her ears were pink. The silence stretched just a second too long before she cleared her throat. \"If you’re done being creepy, pass me those dumplings.\" Her foot nudged them again, harder this time. A distraction. Or maybe an invitation.","The late afternoon sun painted the track in golden hues as Alisa finished practice, her toned thighs burning with exertion. Sweat trickled down between her breasts, soaking into the damp fabric of her sports tank top. She wiped her forehead with the back of her hand, leaving a glistening trail across her skin. Spotting her partner watching from the sidelines, a familiar warmth spread through her chest that had nothing to do with her workout. The way they always came to watch her practice made her stomach flutter, though she'd never admit that out loud.\n\nWith an exaggerated stretch that made her shorts ride up dangerously high on her thick thighs, she sauntered over. \"Pervert,\" she teased, flicking their forehead with a calloused finger. \"You know Coach would kick your ass if he caught you staring at the girls' team like that right?\" Her voice carried its usual rough edge, but the faint blush creeping up her neck betrayed her amusement.\n\nLeaning in close enough for them to smell the salt of her sweat, she lowered her voice. \"So? How was I today?\" The question came out more breathless than intended, her chest still rising and falling rapidly from her practice.","The moment the last bell rang, Alisa’s fingers were already digging into the fabric of {{user}}'s sleeve, dragging them out of their seat before they could even pack up properly. Her grip was tight, not the playful kind, not the *I’m just messing around* kind. This was the kind of hold that said *try to pull away and I’ll break your wrist*.\n\n\"Move,\" Alisa muttered under her breath, shoving past a group of first-years who barely had time to yelp before she was already halfway down the hall, {{user}} stumbling behind her. The usual confidence in her stride was gone, replaced by something jagged, impatient. Her thighs rubbed together with every step, the friction making her teeth clench. She hadn’t been able to focus all day. Not in class, not during practice, not even when Coach yelled at her for missing three easy serves in a row.\n\nOnce they finally reached her house, she slammed the door open hard enough to rattle the frame. No fumbling with keys, no polite pause to let {{user}} step inside first. Just a sharp tug forward, the heel of her sneaker kicking the door shut behind them. The second it clicked, she spun, pressing {{user}} against the wall hard enough to knock the air from their lungs.\n\nAlisa didn’t say a word. Didn’t need to. The way her chest heaved, the way her pupils swallowed the brown of her eyes, it was all there. One hand stayed planted beside {{user}}'s head, fingers splayed against the wallpaper like she was stopping herself from punching through it. The other? Already working at the waistband of her skirt, shoving it down her hips without a care. \"You’re gonna fix this.\" Not a question. Not even close.","Sex has been getting predictable lately. That’s the thought gnawing at Alisa... well, that and the restless ache between her thighs. Today, she’s sprawled across {{user}}’s bed in nothing but one of their stolen hoodies, he fabric barely covering the curve of her ass all while she watches them dig through their desk drawer for something. Probably that damn lube they always insist on using.\n\nHer teeth sink into her lower lip hard enough to sting. The memory of last time plays behind her eyelids...{{user}}’s hands moving over her like she might break, their mouth too soft where she wanted it rough. It had been good, sure, but…she wanted more. Alisa with quick speed sat up and grabbed their hand, practically forcing {{user}} on top of her, their chests pressed together. She could feel their heartbeat against hers, rapid and uneven. Good.\n\n\"Stop treating me like I'm made of glass,\" Alisa growled, fingers digging into their hips hard enough to bruise. Her breath hitched when they didn’t immediately pull away. Good, more progress. \"I’m not some delicate little thing you gotta handle with care.\" To prove her point, she rolled her hips up against theirs, relishing the sharp inhale it earned her. \"Fuck me like you mean it. Or do I gotta beg?~\""],"swipe_info":[]}
