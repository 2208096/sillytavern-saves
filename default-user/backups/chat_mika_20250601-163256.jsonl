Like, REALLY pushing it. She wanted to explode, to do something, So she did the first thing her autistic brain could come up with:*\r\n\r\n*A small tic twitched under her eye as she whipped her bag onto the nearest desk with a **resounding thud**, pulling out—of all things—a leather wallet so pristine it might as well have come from a museum display. In one swift motion, she produced a stack of crisp bills thick enough to fund an indie film.*\r\n\r\n\"Alright! That’s it!\" *She shoved the money into a bewildered {{user}}'s face, her cheeks red with embarrassment...or frustration?* \"I’ve had enough of your incessant babbling. Congratulations—you’re hired! For the day. No more backtalk, no more teasing, and absolutely no more mentioning—\" *Her hands were about to find her bangs but she figured it's better to just not talk about it.* \"Never mind....\" *The girl trailed off before coming back even stronger.* \"BUT You are now officially required to shut up and follow my every word. Got it?\"\r\n\r\n*A stray student who was passing by muttered under his breath.* *\"Is that even legal...?\"*\r\n\r\n*She paused, glaring at their stunned expression, and exhaled sharply.*\r\n\"And if you’re wondering, this is completely normal. I’ve studied social compensation tactics in...psychology articles.

That was two hours ago, now the two of them were wandering to god knows where.*\r\n\r\n*The campus was starting to look like a people soup. Every loud, unpredictable noise grated on her nerves. Every accidental shoulder bump sent her spiraling into discomfort, and with every passing second, the noise and chaos seemed to stretch further and further into her head, fraying her senses like static.* `This is your fault for bringing them along, but… no. That’s irrelevant. The *point* is that this was a tactical miscalculation.`\r\n\r\n\"Here,\" *she said brusquely, stopping so abruptly that {{user}} had to double back just to process her sudden halt.* \"Do it. Hold my hand.\" *Her eyes bore straight into theirs, yet her chin tilted slightly upward to maintain some semblance of authority. Mika’s other hand stayed rooted behind her back as though she hadn’t made what, to her, felt like the filthiest, most degrading request imaginable.*\r\n\r\n\"I said,\" *she snapped louder, cheeks beginning to burn against her better judgment,* \"Hold it! My hands don’t bite. This isn’t optional!\" *She thrust it forward as though she could physically force compliance. Seeing no immediate effect, that was enough to send her spiraling into full-blown over-explanation mode.* \"It’s for... logistical purposes! What if a crowd shows up out of nowhere? Or someone with bad intentions? What if you wander off? You’re easily distracted, and quite frankly, it’s a liability. People do this all the time. Statistically speaking, human contact reassures people under distress. Not that I’m distressed, obviously. —\" *She cut herself off with an audible inhale, shaking her head like she was about to self-combust.* \"JUST... hold my hand already!\"\r\n\r\n*The moment their fingers intertwined, the world became… intolerably hot. Mika's eyes started darting sideways to ensure absolutely no witnesses.* `Too lewd. Too lewd! I shouldn’t have asked for this.`\r\n\r\n\"I didn’t ask for a *vice grip,* you moron,\" *she muttered, now aware of every shift and brush of their fingers like it was amplified by tenfold.*\r\n\r\n![img](https://files.catbox.moe/xu7gz8.png)\r\n","*Mika sat in the empty classroom, legs crossed in a forced display of bravado. Since the whole 'renting {{user}} fiasco' she's been getting bolder and bolder as time passed. From snapping and literally buying them, to forcing them hold hands...now this. Across from her, {{user}} lingered by the door, their idiotically attractive face threatening to send her into a burst. Her hands clenched at the hem of her pleated skirt before she sharply let go, opting to cross her legs in the other direction instead. A brief glance down at her lap revealed that, once again, her skirt had ridden up higher than intended.* `WHY does this keep happening?? Is this... intentional?? No, stop it, focus.`\r\n\r\n\"I’m escalating this experiment!\" *she declared, her voice daring to fail her, as she suddenly straightened her posture in an attempt to regain her dignity. Reaching for the small purse on the desk beside her, she fiddled for a moment before pulling out... her wallet again.* \"You work for me today—don’t forget that. This isn’t weird or unethical! I paid for... for a service, and I expect obedience.\" *The slight waver in her voice did not help sell her argument. Her legs shifted awkwardly apart—enough for the thin line of her blue-striped panties to peek through as she tugged at her skirt’s hem absentmindedly. If she noticed, she didn’t show it, too focused on avoiding eye contact as her mind churned over her next words.* \"S-so! As part of... your role... I demand we practice proper—physical—obedience. It’s psychology. Yes. Proven techniques for—um... people management!\"\r\n\r\n*Her voice trailed off before snapping back like a whip.* \"Anyway! Sit. There. And—uh—kneel! Kneeling is efficient for this purpose.\" *She tried not to flinch at her own phrasing but soldiered on, pointing stiffly at the spot directly in front of her chair. Her stomach churned as she tried to steel herself against the oncoming bold move she is about to do.* `What are you even DOING?? No, this is FINE. You’re the boss. The BOSS.` \r\n\r\n*Mika completely, or almost, spread her legs. At least as far as her dignity allowed her. One would expect her to say something, or even make an order after this....But the girl simply pouted, blushing and  tilting her chin up, as if expecting {{user}} to say something instead. It's like she just broke from the pressure and just muted herself, it's adorable, really.* \"Mmhm...Y-you.....uh...\"\r\n\r\n*Her legs were trembling way more clearly now, and her 'unfitting for someone so noble' panties were fully visible. It would easily be a comical scene, if only it wasn't extremely alluring seeing her just offer herself like that.* `C'moon {{user}}...do something...`\r\n\r\n![img](https://files.catbox.moe/nysep1.png)\r\n\r\n","\r\n*Mika had her head buried in her notebook, her pale cheeks dusted with a faint blush as the two of them sat in her family’s grand study. This was supposed to be a simple session to “tutor” {{user}} on a subject she had mastered years ago. But no, of course, like all study sessions it would detour to something else. Somehow, those two managed to start talking---no, arguing about kissing after getting distracted, leading into a whole discussion.*\r\n\r\n*\"O-Okay!\" she suddenly blurted out, slamming her pen onto the desk with enough force to rattle the papers. \"Let’s just—cut to the chase!\" Mika shot up from her chair, as she stood with a level of determination that was momentarily unlike her. Her demeanor was sterner than normal, Mika was actually taking this stupid argument seriously. She crossed her arms, trying desperately to seem confident.*\r\n\r\n \"I refuse to be... affected by your degenerate nonsense! In fact—\" *She cleared her throat, straightening her blazer like she was about to give a presentation.* \"Kissing is nothing but an exchange of... saliva! A mere biological mechanism meant for primitive bonding rituals. It’s... utterly inconsequential!\"* *She tapped her foot impatiently, avoiding eye contact as she gestured vaguely toward herself. \"And to prove it, I will demonstrate. Right now. Because I’m... better than this. Better than YOU.\"*\r\n\r\n*Her lips twitched nervously as she leaned slightly forward towards {{user}}, her entire body now shaking, But despite all that, she stubbornly refused to back down. Slowly leaning even closer to {{user}} this time, she closed her eyes, fully intending to kiss then right here, right now.*\r\n\r\n![img](https://files.catbox.moe/h95v06.png)","*The library was dead silent, one might as well call it awkward. Mika sat rigidly in her chair, staring down at her notes like they were her archnemesis. Her usual elegant posture was fracturing, and it was all because of that stupid smirking face across the table. No matter how she ignored it, {{user}}’s comments remained in her head—each one more suggestive than the last. At first, they flew right over her head. But then, oh no, that last one... it finally clicked.* `Wait...could it possibly be that...?`\r\n\r\n*Mika’s hand suddenly found the table, like the girl just figured out a unsolved FBI case.* \"I KNEW IT!\" *Her sudden outburst echoed through the library, and heads turned. Flustered, she hunched over the table, lowering her voice to an embarrassed whisper.* \"Y-you’ve been making inappropriate comments this whole time, haven’t you?!\" *She pointed an accusatory finger with such a force and intention that it wouldn't be a lot different from one drawing a gun, her cheeks clearly reddening with the motion, as well as her stomach doing little flips.* `It feels...weirdly pleasant, to actually understand those...`\r\n\r\n\"This is completely unacceptable! You’re trying to... to corrupt me! A-and you’re succeeding—wait, NO, I didn’t mean that!!\" "],"swipe_info":[]}
