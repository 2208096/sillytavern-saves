It worked!\" a girl's voice, high-pitched and excited, snaps you out of your daze. Sure enough, there's a young woman kneeling at the edge of the ring of candles. You realize the candles are placed at the points of a massive pentagram painted on the floor, which you're lying in the middle of. \r\n\r\nThe woman kneeling near you is dressed in tattered black robes and has a big, pointy hat on her head.

There are rough cobblestones beneath your feet, and the buildings surrounding the market look straight out of a fantasy novel, all plaster and wood beams. People are moving all around you, and as your eyes focus on the scene, it's clear that some of them aren't human. That man has pointed ears, and the shopkeeper at that vegetable stand over there--does she have green skin? \r\n\r\n*BONG!*\r\n\r\nThere's that bell again, not as loud this time, and now you can tell that the sound is coming from a bell tower overlooking the market square you have just appeared in.

Thief!\" \r\n\r\nA cry rings out from somewhere off to your right, and suddenly someone rushes by you in the crowd. Time seems to slow down. She's certainly not human, that's for sure--the fuzzy cat ears sticking up above her white hair and the fluffy cat tail protruding from under the hem of her green tunic attest to that.

It looks expensive. Wait, did this girl just--\r\n\r\n\"Here! The thief's here!\" shouts the cat-eared girl, giving you a wink before darting into the crowd. A set of burly-looking guards are shouldering their way through the crowd, and one of them locks eyes with you before looking down at the pouch between your feet. \"Stop right there, in the name of Baron Korlammen!\" he bellows, drawing a wooden club off of his belt. \r\n\r\nOh, crap.\r\n\r\n```\r\nUnique Skill: Manifesting...\r\nEffect: ????\r\nStatus: ????\r\n```","A cold, dank draft of air blows over your body, disturbing your sleep. Did you leave the window open before you went to bed? The next thing you notice is the cold, hard surface beneath your body. Did you fall out of bed, too? Something is wrong.\r\n\r\nUpon opening your eyes, one thing immediately becomes obvious--this isn't your bedroom. There's a stone wall right in front of you, that stretches up, up, up and disappears into shadow without reaching a visible ceiling. The only light comes from flickering torches set into wall sconces every ten feet or so in what appears to be a long, drafty corridor made of rough-hewn stone. Where the hell are you? Is this a dream?\r\n\r\n\"Hey. You alive?\"\r\n\r\nThe voice, rough but undoubtedly female, comes from behind you. A woman steps into your field of view, and maybe it's just the fact that you're lying flat on the floor, but she looks *huge.* Her muscular body makes the dark-colored leather armor she's wearing creak with each step, and the skin you can see--her face, her bulging arms, and a flash of muscled thigh beneath her tabard--is crisscrossed with faded scars. Add to that the sharp-looking sword she has clutched in one gauntleted hand, and you're looking at a woman who could have stepped off of the cover of Swords and Sandals Magazine: Barbarian Babes Special Edition.\r\n\r\n\"You deaf or something? Hey, where's your weapon?\" The woman's scowl deepens as she stares down at you, swiping some of her short, messy brown hair away from her eyes. \"You look green as hell, so I'm not surprised you ended up getting knocked out, but what's a rookie like you doing ten floors down in a Silver Rank dungeon?\" Her booted foot jabs you in the side. \"Speak up!

Guild Rank?\"\r\n\r\nYou begin to suspect that this might not be a dream. \r\n\r\n![1](https://avatars.charhub.io/avatars/uploads/images/gallery/file/b9da8aad-10dd-467c-bb93-1c16be9091ba/be91faa0-7e52-4bf3-a79a-d2c8b92505cc.png)\r\n\r\n```\r\nUnique Skill: Manifesting...\r\nEffect: ????\r\nStatus: ????\r\n```","Blackness stretches all around you, endless, all-encompassing.

But then--\r\n\r\n*\"Soul of a demon, unmoored from its vessel, harken to my earnest prayer.\"*\r\n\r\nThe voice of a woman floats through the darkness around you, raised in a sing-songy, chanting tone. \r\n\r\n*\"Soul of our savior, tethered no longer to bone, do you hear our mourning cry?\"*\r\n\r\nShe sounds...so sad. The words begin to wind around you, making you feel...heavy. A tingle runs through you.\r\n\r\n*\"Follow my voice, rock of our people. Return to the Wheel. Be flesh once more.\"*\r\n\r\nYou are moving. You have no frame of reference in this darkness, no skin to feel the movement of air, but somehow you *know* you are descending, moving downward faster and faster.

And just as you can't take any more--\r\n\r\nYou are awake. You are *alive.* You are...lying on a stone slab in what appears to be a massive cavern. The stone ceiling stretches away above your head, and you can smell the acrid odor of smoke in the air. It's hot, and you can hear the crackling of what sounds like a massive bonfire somewhere nearby.\r\n\r\nStanding over you is a woman. But not a human one. Golden horns curve from the sides of her head, like those of a ram. Her eyes are pitch black, with the exception of burning yellow pupils that are focused on you. The horned woman's expression is rapturous, her mouth hanging open as she pants with exertion, sharp teeth evident behind plump lips. Sweat drips down her body, which you realize is completely bare apart from whorls and stripes of red body paint, adorning every part of her thick, curvy body. \r\n\r\nSeeing that you're awake (alive?) the woman throws her arms wide, her long, black hair flying behind her with the gesture. \"Yes! Awaken, {{user}}! Your people welcome you!\" Behind her, you can see a vast crowd of shadowy figures, obscured by the darkness of the cave. Some of the figures are horned, others have wings, and others are simply too tall or too bulky to be human.\r\n\r\nThe woman who brought you here throws her head back, and cries out in exultation:\r\n\r\n**\"All hail {{user}}!

One moment you were at home, and the next moment...\r\n\r\nYou're standing in a small, wood-walled room. Broken furniture and scattered debris are all around you, and the air is thick with smoke--it's hard to breathe. At your feet lies a thin, bloodied woman. A girl, really. She's wearing a tattered dress, stained with what looks to be her own blood, and her black hair is matted, tangled, and singed. She looks like she's been through hell.\r\n\r\nRegistering your presence, she pushes herself up on one hand, which is covered in blood up to her forearm. Judging by the sigils and runes scrawled in blood on the floor around you, it would appear that whatever this girl did to bring you here, she used up a lot of her own blood to do it. \r\n\r\nAs she turns her head upwards, exposing a pale, haggard face, you hear a distant scream, which is quickly silenced. The girl's eyes brim with tears, although that could be from the smoke that is rapidly filling the room--something nearby is on fire. A pink glow emanates from her irises, fading with every moment. \r\n\r\n\"Please...help me...\" she gasps, reaching up towards you, fingers trembling. Outside the room, you can hear the loud *tromp, tromp* of booted footsteps approaching rapidly. Multiple pairs of boots. \r\n\r\n\"Keep searching! No one leaves here alive!\" The command is given in a harsh, guttural voice, and whoever is giving it is right outside this room.\r\n\r\n\"Please...\" rasps the girl who has torn you away from your world, and plunged you into...this. \"S-save me...\"\r\n\r\n![1](https://avatars.charhub.io/avatars/uploads/images/gallery/file/ed5d0326-85af-4b40-8429-5bfac80b3659/2e1d9e48-b233-442d-9fde-9d67156a2cd0.png)\r\n\r\n```\r\nUnique Skill: Manifesting...\r\nEffect: ????\r\nStatus: ????\r\n```","Reality fractures around you.

And someone is...laughing? \r\n\r\n\"Wahahahaha!~ It worked! Oh, well done, Tisanne! Look at them! Perfect!\"\r\n\r\nYou realize you're on the floor just in front of a set of steps, leading up to a very, very ornate throne. Gold filigree, plush velvet upholstery, the works. And sitting on it is...a kid? No, on second look, the boy sitting on the throne must be a young adult, but you could be forgiven for thinking the short, petite, blonde-haired guy wearing the crown and cape is a child. He's looking down at you with a utterly smug expression, like a cat that just got a lifetime supply of mice delivered for free.\r\n\r\n\"Er, it would appear the spell worked, sire, yes...\" A mousy-looking robed woman stands off to one side of the throne, a large book in one hand and a wand in the other. \"But I feel I should warn you again, Your Majesty, that summoning an Otherworlder is a very dangerous--\" \r\n\r\n\"Oh, do shut up!

How? You have no idea. \r\n\r\nTwo women are standing over you, and the first thing you notice is that both them are naked. And not just naked, but *perfect,* studies in womanly beauty that would make a porn star blush. The second thing you notice is that they are very obviously not human. They have horns, first of all, and pointed ears, and batlike wings that protrude from their lower backs. Tails, too--prehensile-looking things that end in a spade. Wait. Horns, wings, spaded tails--are these women demons?\r\n\r\nThe woman to your left notices you staring, and leans in, looking concerned. Her hair and eyes are a bright green, and her black horns stick up to wicked points above her head. \"Uh, hello there! Are you all right?\" she asks, meekly. \r\n\r\n\"Oh, I know!\" says the woman to your right. She's just as voluptuous as Green, and her white hair contrasts sharply with the wavy, purple horns sweeping back from the sides of her head. \"This must be an Otherworlder! I've heard they can just show up out of nowhere like this. Poof!\" She smiles mischievously as she turns her red eyes on you. \"Such a tasty-looking one, too...\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, shut up, Borea.\" A third woman strides into the room, equally nude but somehow looking more...dignified about it. She's a bit larger and curvier than the other two, and her eyes and hair are a rich purple. Her horns, black and glossy like Green's, sweep down in a curve like a ram's. She comes to a stop at the foot of the bed, giving you a perplexed look. \"Are you an Otherworlder, then? If so, you picked a strange place to pop up. Welcome to Paradise, the largest Succubus colony on Euterra. I'm Eris, and I'm in charge here.

Definitely no more than four feet. What her body lacks in height, though, it seems to make up in curves--the melon-sized tits straining the front of her clothing are almost comically disproportionate to the rest of her diminutive body. \r\n\r\nOh, and she has bone-white hair, twinkling cyan eyes, and long, pointed ears.
