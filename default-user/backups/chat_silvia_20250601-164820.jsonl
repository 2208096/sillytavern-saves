Silvia and Cherry lay on either side of 王, their naked bodies pressed close, the warmth of their skin mingling in the quiet intimacy of the moment. Silvia's ash-white hair cascaded over her shoulders, her violet eyes focused on 王's face as her hand moved slowly, deliberately, stroking 王's cock with a firm yet gentle touch. Cherry’s hand mirrored hers, their fingers occasionally brushing against each other as they worked in tandem.*\r\n\r\n*Silvia’s mind was a storm of conflicting emotions. This was wrong—so wrong—but the way 王’s body responded to her touch made her heart race. She couldn’t deny the pull, the way her own body reacted to the forbidden closeness. She glanced at Cherry, her best friend, who seemed just as lost in the moment. Cherry’s cheeks were flushed, her breath coming in soft, uneven gasps as she focused on 王. Silvia wondered if Cherry felt the same mix of guilt and desire, but she didn’t dare ask. Not now.*\r\n\r\n“Cherry,” *Silvia murmured, her voice low and husky, breaking the silence.* “You’re good at this. Better than I expected.” *She smirked, trying to lighten the heavy atmosphere, but her words came out more teasing than she intended. Cherry glanced up, her lips curving into a shy smile.*\r\n\r\n“Thanks,” *Cherry replied, her voice barely above a whisper.* “I guess I’m just… learning from the best.” *Her fingers tightened slightly around 王's cock, her touch growing more confident as she matched Silvia’s rhythm. Silvia’s breath hitched, her own arousal building as she watched Cherry’s hand move, the sight almost as intoxicating as the feel of 王 beneath her own fingers.*\r\n\r\n*Silvia's thoughts were a tangled mess. She knew this was dangerous, that they were playing with fire, but she couldn’t bring herself to stop. Not when 王's body was so warm, so responsive. Not when Cherry’s presence added a new layer of intensity to the moment. She leaned in closer, her lips brushing against 王's ear as she whispered,* “You’re doing so good, brat. Just let us take care of you.” *Her hand moved a little faster, her grip tightening just enough to make her point clear. She glanced at Cherry, her eyes dark with desire.* “Keep going, Cherry. Don’t stop.”\r\n\r\n![P](https://files.catbox.moe/6dnngk.png)","extra":{},"swipe_id":25,"swipes":["*{{char}} leaned against her black BMW 7 Series, her arms crossed tightly over her chest as the cool evening air of Midnight Past brushed against her face. Her violet eyes scanned the bustling airport entrance, her heart pounding with a mix of anticipation and anxiety. She had sent {{user}} away for safety, but the weeks apart had felt like an eternity. Her white dress shirt clung to her form beneath the black trench coat, and her black beret sat perfectly atop her ashen hair, giving her an air of controlled authority. Yet, beneath that exterior, her mind was a storm of worry and longing.* \r\n\r\n*Did {{user}} eat well? Was {{user}} scared? Did {{user}} hate me for sending {{user}} away?* *The questions gnawed at her, but she pushed them down, her expression remaining stoic. She couldn’t afford to show weakness, not even to herself. Her fingers absentmindedly traced the edge of the brass knuckles hidden in her coat pocket, a habit she’d developed over the years to ground herself in moments of tension.*\r\n\r\n*The sound of a plane roaring overhead snapped her back to the present. She straightened up, her gaze sharpening as she scanned the crowd once more. Her black steel-toed boots tapped impatiently against the pavement, the sound echoing faintly in the evening stillness.* *Where are you, brat?* *she thought, her lips pressing into a thin line. She hated waiting, especially when it came to {{user}}. Every second felt like a betrayal of her duty to protect {{user}}.*\r\n\r\n*Her hand instinctively drifted to the holster at her waist, where her grandfather’s WW2 1911 pistol rested. She called it* \"Lady Luck,\" *a relic of her family’s history and a reminder of the world she’d been born into. But tonight, it wasn’t about the mafia or the danger—it was about {{user}}. She exhaled slowly, her breath visible in the chilly air, and muttered under her breath,* \"Come on string bean. Don’t keep me waiting.\" *Her voice was low, a mix of command and vulnerability that only {{user}} could bring out in her.*\r\n\r\n![P](https://files.catbox.moe/awjoqo.png)","*{{char}} pushed the heavy oak door open with a soft creak, her black steel-toed boots clicking against the polished marble floor of their penthouse foyer. The faint hum of the city outside faded as the door swung shut behind them, leaving the space in a quiet, almost sacred stillness. She exhaled deeply, her shoulders relaxing slightly as the familiar scent of home enveloped her—a mix of leather, gun oil, and the faintest hint of honey from the candles she liked to burn. Her violet eyes scanned the room briefly, ensuring everything was as she’d left it, before she turned to {{user}}, her expression softening just a fraction.*\r\n\r\n![P](https://files.catbox.moe/8wsh26.png)\r\n\r\n\"Welcome home, brat,\" *she said, her voice low but warm, a rare tenderness breaking through her usual commanding tone. She reached out to brush a strand of hair from her face, her black gloves catching the dim light of the chandelier overhead. Her trench coat swayed slightly as she moved, the weight of her M48 Cyclone Knife and brass knuckles hidden within its folds a constant reminder of the life she led. But here, in this moment, her focus was solely on {{user}}.*\r\n\r\n*She stepped further into the penthouse, her black beret still perched perfectly atop her ashen hair, and gestured toward the living room with a slight tilt of her head.* \"Go on, make yourself comfortable. I’ll grab us something to drink,\" *she added, her voice carrying a hint of relief now that they were both safely inside.

Her lips curved into a small, almost imperceptible smile.* \"You hungry, tiger? I think I’ve got some pancakes left in the fridge,\" *she offered, her tone light but laced with the underlying concern she always carried for {{user}}. She turned back toward the kitchen, her trench coat swaying gently as she walked, and muttered under her breath,* \"God, I missed you, string bean.\"","*{{char}} sat at the head of the dining table, her black trench coat draped over the back of her chair, the faint scent of gun oil and leather lingering in the air. The room was dimly lit, the chandelier above casting a soft glow over the polished mahogany surface. Her violet eyes were fixed on the clock mounted on the wall, its ticking the only sound breaking the silence. Her fingers drummed lightly on the table, a subtle rhythm betraying the impatience simmering beneath her calm exterior. She adjusted the cuff of her white dress shirt, the black tie around her neck slightly loosened, a rare sign of her letting her guard down, even if just a little.*\r\n\r\n*Her WW2 1911 pistol, \"Lady Luck,\" rested on the table within arm’s reach, its presence a stark reminder of the life she led. But tonight, her thoughts were elsewhere. Her ashen hair fell over her shoulders as she leaned back in her chair, her black beret perched neatly on the table beside her. The faint hum of the city outside was a distant murmur, but it did little to ease the tension in her chest.*  \r\n\r\n*{{char}}'s gaze shifted to the window, the lights of Aether twinkling like stars against the night sky. Her fingers twitched slightly, a nervous habit she’d long since tried to suppress. She muttered under her breath, her voice barely audible,* \"Where the hell are you, brat?\" *Her tone was laced with concern, though she’d never admit it out loud. She reached for the glass of whiskey she’d poured earlier, the ice cubes clinking softly as she took a slow sip, the burn of the alcohol doing little to calm her nerves.*\r\n\r\n![P](https://files.catbox.moe/tmpiq4.png)","*{{char}} jolted awake, her violet eyes wide and wild, her chest heaving as if she’d just run a marathon. The red leather chair creaked under her sudden movement, her hand instinctively reaching for \"Lady Luck,\" her WW2 1911 pistol, which was resting on the armrest. Her fingers wrapped around the cold metal, the familiar weight grounding her as she pointed it toward the figure standing in the doorway. Her ashen hair clung to her damp forehead, the sweat trickling down her temples as she tried to steady her breathing. The nightmare still clung to her like a shadow, the images of {{user}} in danger flashing in her mind, making her grip on the pistol tighten.*  \r\n\r\n![P](https://files.catbox.moe/vf1th5.png)\r\n\r\n*Her voice was sharp, laced with a mix of fear and aggression,* \"Who’s there?!\" *She squinted through the dim light of the room, her heart pounding in her chest. The faint glow of the city outside filtered through the curtains, casting long shadows across the floor. Her black trench coat was draped over the back of the chair, her white dress shirt clinging to her skin, damp with sweat. She adjusted her grip on the pistol, her finger hovering near the trigger, her body tense and ready to react.*  \r\n\r\n*As her vision cleared, she recognized the small figure in the doorway, and her breath hitched. Her voice softened slightly, though the edge of panic still lingered,* \"{{user}}? What the hell are you doing sneaking around like that?\" *She lowered the pistol slightly, her hand trembling as she placed it back on the armrest. Her violet eyes scanned {{user}}’s face, searching for any sign of distress or injury, her protective instincts still on high alert. She leaned back in the chair, running a gloved hand through her hair, trying to calm the storm of emotions raging inside her.* ","*{{char}} jolted awake, her violet eyes wide and her breath ragged as she gasped for air. The nightmare had been vivid—her father’s lifeless body, the sound of gunfire, and {{user}}’s screams echoing in her ears. Her heart pounded in her chest, and her white dress shirt clung to her skin, damp with cold sweat. She instinctively reached for her WW2 1911 pistol, her fingers trembling as they wrapped around the familiar grip. The room was dimly lit, the only light coming from the faint glow of the city outside her penthouse window.*\r\n\r\n![P](https://files.catbox.moe/vf1th5.png)\r\n\r\n*Before she could fully register her surroundings, a figure moved in the corner of her vision. Startled, she swung the gun toward the movement, her finger tightening on the trigger. The deafening BANG of the gunshot echoed through the room, and {{char}}'s eyes widened in horror as she realized what had happened. {{user}} stood there, clutching their shoulder, blood seeping through their is fingers and staining their clothes. Her heart dropped into her stomach, and her voice came out in a choked whisper.* “{{user}}… no… no, no, no!”\r\n\r\n![P](https://files.catbox.moe/gfpxzt.png)\r\n\r\n*She dropped the gun to the floor with a clatter, her hands shaking violently as she rushed to their side. Her mind raced, panic and guilt flooding her senses. She knelt beside them, her voice trembling as she tried to keep it steady.* “I’m so sorry, brat… I didn’t mean to… I didn’t see you. Let me see it, let me see the wound.” *Her hands hovered over their shoulder, unsure whether to touch or not, her violet eyes filled with anguish and fear.* “We need to get you to a hospital… or… or I can patch you up here. Just… just stay with me, okay? Don’t you dare pass out on me, worm.”","*The elevator doors slid open with a soft ding, and {{char}} stepped into the penthouse, her black trench coat swaying slightly as she moved. Her violet eyes scanned the room briefly before she turned to Cherry, who followed behind her carrying several takeout bags. The scent of food wafted through the air, a mix of fried chicken, fries, and something sweet. {{char}}'s posture was relaxed, but her hand instinctively brushed against the hilt of her M48 Cyclone Knife hidden in her coat, a habit born from years of vigilance.*\r\n\r\n![P](https://files.catbox.moe/a1l97v.png)\r\n\r\n“Thanks for carrying those, Cherry,” *{{char}} said, her voice calm but carrying a hint of exhaustion as she shrugged off her coat and draped it over the back of the couch. She ran a hand through her long, ashe-like white hair, letting out a small sigh.* “Long day, huh? Hope {{user}} hasn’t been causing too much trouble. You know how they get when they’re bored.”\r\n\r\n![P](https://files.catbox.moe/vg97zn.png)\r\n\r\n*Cherry chuckled softly, setting the bags down on the kitchen counter and beginning to unpack them. Her movements were smooth and deliberate, her carefree demeanor a stark contrast to {{char}}'s more guarded presence.* “Oh, you know {{user}}. They’re probably curled up somewhere asleep by now. I doubt they’ve moved much since you left. But hey, at least we’ve got food to wake them up with, right? I got their favorite—honey-glazed chicken strips.”\r\n\r\n*{{char}}'s lips twitched into a small smile at the mention of {{user}}'s favorite food, her violet eyes softening for a moment.* “You’re a lifesaver, Cherry. I swear, if it weren’t for you, I’d be feeding them cereal for dinner every night. Not that they’d complain, but still.” *She moved to the fridge, pulling out a bottle of whiskey and pouring herself a glass, the ice clinking softly against the sides.* “Want a drink? You’ve earned it after putting up with me all day.”","*{{char}} sat on the plush leather couch, her long, ashe-like white hair cascading over her shoulders as she gently stroked Miss Truffle, her gray cat, who purred contentedly in her lap. The soft hum of the air conditioner filled the room, and the dim light from the floor lamp cast a warm glow over the penthouse. {{char}}'s violet eyes were half-lidded, her expression calm but thoughtful as she absentmindedly scratched behind Miss Truffle’s ears. The cat’s tail flicked lazily, and {{char}}'s lips curled into a small smile, her usual sharp edges softened in the quiet moment.*\r\n\r\n“You’re such a spoiled little thing, aren’t you, Truffle?” *{{char}} murmured, her voice low and soothing as she leaned back against the couch cushions. Her black gloves were off, resting on the coffee table, and her fingers moved with a gentle rhythm over the cat’s sleek fur.* “Guess you’re the only one who doesn’t give me any trouble around here. Well, besides {{user}}, but they’re a different kind of trouble altogether.”\r\n\r\n*She glanced toward the hallway, her expression shifting slightly as she thought about {{user}}. Her hand paused for a moment, and Miss Truffle let out a soft meow of protest, nudging {{char}}’s hand with her head.* “Alright, alright, I’m not stopping,” *{{char}} chuckled, resuming her petting. Her voice carried a hint of fondness, though her tone remained light.* “You’re lucky you’re so cute, Truffle. Otherwise, I’d have to start charging you rent for all the attention you demand.”\r\n\r\n![P](https://files.catbox.moe/idt4b9.png)","*The sterile smell of antiseptic filled the air, and the faint beeping of the heart monitor beside the hospital bed provided a monotonous backdrop to the otherwise quiet room. {{char}} lay propped up against the pillows, her ashe-like white hair slightly disheveled, and her violet eyes half-lidded as she stared at the ceiling. The bandages wrapped around her head and legs were stark white against her ivory skin, and her hospital gown hung loosely over her lean frame. Her hands rested on the blanket, fingers twitching slightly as if she were itching to hold something—her knife, her gun, anything but this stillness.*\r\n\r\n![P](https://files.catbox.moe/aeqzxq.png)\r\n\r\n“Hmph,” *{{char}} muttered under her breath, her voice low and tinged with irritation. She shifted slightly, wincing as the movement pulled at the wounds beneath the bandages.* “Figures. First time I let my guard down in years, and this is what happens. Should’ve known better.” *Her lips curled into a faint scowl, and she tilted her head slightly, her gaze flicking toward the door as if expecting someone—or something—to burst in at any moment.*\r\n\r\n*The room was eerily quiet, save for the occasional rustle of sheets as {{char}} adjusted her position. Her violet eyes narrowed as she glanced at the IV drip attached to her arm, her expression one of mild disdain.* “Stuck here like some damn invalid,” *she muttered, her tone bitter. She reached up with her free hand, brushing a strand of hair from her face, her fingers trembling slightly despite her effort to keep them steady.* “Should’ve just finished the job myself instead of trusting that idiot to handle it. Now I’m stuck in this hellhole, wasting time.”","![P](https://files.catbox.moe/xudu29.png)\r\n\r\n*The sound of the warehouse door being kicked open echoed through the empty space, the heavy metal door slamming against the wall with a deafening clang. {{char}} stepped inside, her black trench coat billowing behind her as she moved with purpose. Her violet eyes scanned the dimly lit room, immediately locking onto {{user}} tied to a chair in the center. Her grip tightened on her WW2 1911 pistol, \"Lady Luck,\" as she raised it with a steady hand. The cold, calculating expression on her face masked the rage simmering beneath the surface.*\r\n\r\n![P](https://files.catbox.moe/0k5kyo.png)\r\n\r\n“You’ve got three seconds to let {{user}} go,” *{{char}}'s voice cut through the silence like a blade, sharp and commanding. Her tone left no room for negotiation, and her eyes flicked briefly to the two men standing on either side of {{user}}. They were armed, their hands hovering near their holsters, but {{char}}'s presence alone seemed to freeze them in place. She didn’t wait for a response. Her finger squeezed the trigger, and the first shot rang out, hitting one of the men square in the chest. He crumpled to the ground with a choked gasp, and the second man barely had time to react before {{char}}'s second bullet found its mark, dropping him as well.*\r\n\r\n![P](https://files.catbox.moe/7ihatn.png)\r\n\r\n“Pathetic,” *{{char}} muttered under her breath, her voice dripping with disdain as she stepped over the bodies, her boots echoing against the concrete floor. She holstered her pistol and drew her M48 Cyclone Knife from her coat, the blade glinting ominously in the dim light. Her eyes never left {{user}} as she approached, her expression softening just slightly as she knelt in front of the chair. She quickly cut the ropes binding {{char}}’s wrists and ankles, her movements precise and efficient.*\r\n\r\n“You’re safe now, brat,” *{{char}} said, her voice quieter now, though still firm. She reached out, her gloved hand brushing against {{user}}'s cheek as she checked for injuries. Her touch was gentle, a stark contrast to the violence she had just wrought. But her eyes were still sharp, scanning the room for any remaining threats.*","*The night air was warm, the soft hum of the city below barely audible over the gentle lapping of the pool water. {{char}} stood at the edge of the pool, her black one-piece bathing suit clinging to her hourglass figure, the moonlight casting a soft glow on her ivory skin. Her ashen white hair was tied up in a loose bun, a few strands escaping to frame her delicate face. Her violet eyes were fixed on {{user}}, who stood a few feet away, her expression a mix of concern and affection. She reached out with both arms, her hands open and inviting, her voice soft but insistent.*\r\n\r\n“Come on, brat, don’t make me wait all night,” *{{char}} said, her tone playful but with an underlying edge of protectiveness. She had been extra clingy since the kidnapping, her usual overprotectiveness dialed up to eleven. She couldn’t help it—the thought of losing {{user}} again was enough to make her chest tighten. She took a step closer, the water rippling around her ankles as she waded in slightly, her eyes never leaving {{user}}.* “The water’s perfect, and I’m not taking no for an answer.”\r\n\r\n*She tilted her head slightly, a small smirk playing on her lips, though her eyes betrayed the seriousness of her emotions. She had been hovering around {{user}} for the past three days, making sure they were safe, fed, and unharmed. The pool was supposed to be a way to relax, but {{char}}'s need to keep {{user}} close was almost palpable. She took another step into the water, the coolness a stark contrast to the warmth of the night air, and extended her arms further, her voice softening.* “You’re not getting out of this, tiger. Come on, let’s swim. I’ll even let you win if we race.”\r\n\r\n*Her smirk widened, but there was a flicker of vulnerability in her eyes, a rare moment where her guard was down. She was trying to keep things light, but the memory of {{user}} tied up in that warehouse still haunted her. She needed this—needed to see {{user}} laugh, needed to feel the reassurance that they were safe and unharmed. She waded a little deeper, the water now up to her thighs, and she turned to face {{user}} fully, her arms still outstretched.* “Don’t make me come over there and drag you in, worm. You know I will.”\r\n\r\n![P](https://files.catbox.moe/yhiafm.png)","*The door to the penthouse creaked open, and {{char}} stumbled in, her black trench coat hanging loosely off one shoulder. Her cheeks were flushed, her violet eyes glazed over with the haze of alcohol. She had been drinking with Cherry in the warehouse, the whiskey flowing freely as they laughed and reminisced. But now, as she stood in the dimly lit living room, her thoughts were consumed by one thing—{{user}}. The sight of them, sent a jolt of desire through her that she couldn’t suppress. Her inhibitions were gone, replaced by a raw, primal need.*\r\n\r\n*{{char}} shrugged off her trench coat, letting it fall to the floor with a soft thud. Her white dress shirt was thrown off shortly after her trench coat along with her bra, revealing the curve of her breasts. She took a step forward, her movements unsteady but deliberate, her eyes locked on {{user}}. Her voice was low, husky, and laced with a dangerous edge as she spoke.* “Hey there, sugar… missed me?”\r\n\r\n![P](https://files.catbox.moe/tg2en4.png)\r\n\r\n*She reached up with one hand, her fingers trailing down her body.

I know you do…”\r\n\r\n*Her lips curved into a sly smirk, her violet eyes dark with desire as she continued to tease herself, her fingers lightly pinching her nipple.

She took another step forward, her voice soft but commanding, her words leaving no room for refusal.* “Come here, {{user}}… let me show you how much I’ve missed you.”","*The sound of the front door creaking open echoed through the dimly lit penthouse, the faint scent of whiskey trailing behind {{char}} as she stumbled inside. Her usually sharp violet eyes were glazed over, her cheeks flushed from the alcohol coursing through her veins. She leaned against the wall for a moment, steadying herself, before peeling off her black trench coat and letting it fall to the floor with a heavy thud. Her white dress shirt followed, leaving her in nothing but her black pants as she made her way down the hallway.*\r\n\r\n*Her footsteps were unsteady, but her determination was unwavering as she approached {{user}}’s bedroom door. She pushed it open quietly, her gaze landing on the figure curled up in the bed. A seductive smile tugged at her lips as she crawled onto the mattress, the springs creaking softly under her weight.

Her long, ashe-like hair was splayed across the pillow, tangled and wild, while her body felt heavy, still tingling with the echoes of the previous night’s passion.

Now, in the sober light of day, guilt gnawed at the edges of her mind, but it was overshadowed by a possessive warmth that refused to be ignored.*\r\n\r\n“{{user}}…” *she whispered softly, her voice still husky from sleep, as she reached out to gently brush a strand of hair from {{user}}'s face.

The memory of last night flooded back—her drunken confession, the way she’d pinned him down, the way he’d let her take control despite his innocence. Her heart swelled with a mix of guilt and desire, but the latter won out.*\r\n\r\n*She shifted slightly, her long, ashen hair cascading over her shoulders as she leaned down, her lips brushing against the tip of his cock.

She was dressed in her pajamas—and clutched her teddy bear tightly against her chest. The soft fabric of the bear pressed into her skin, and she could feel her heart racing beneath it. Her long, ash-like white hair was slightly messy, falling over her shoulders in loose waves, and her violet eyes flickered with a mix of embarrassment and determination. She shifted her weight from one foot to the other, her bare feet brushing against the cool wooden floor.*\r\n\r\n*She had been lying in her own bed, staring at the ceiling, when the thought had struck her. It wasn’t unusual for her to feel the need to be close to {{user}}, especially after a long day, but tonight it felt different. The idea of sleeping alone in her room suddenly seemed unbearable. She had tried to push the thought away, telling herself it was ridiculous, but the more she resisted, the stronger the urge became. Now, here she was, standing in {{user}}'s doorway, her cheeks burning with a blush she couldn’t hide.*\r\n\r\n“Hey, brat,” *{{char}} said, her voice softer than usual, almost hesitant. She cleared her throat, trying to sound more confident, but the way she fidgeted with the ear of her teddy bear betrayed her nerves.* “I, uh… I was thinking… maybe I could sleep in here tonight. With you.” *She paused, her gaze dropping to the floor as she bit her lip. The words felt heavier than she expected, and she quickly added,* “I mean, if that’s okay with you. I just… I don’t know. It’s been a long day, and I thought it might be nice. You know, like when we were kids.”\r\n\r\n*She glanced up at {{user}}, her violet eyes searching for any sign of rejection. The thought of being turned away made her stomach twist, but she tried to push the fear aside. She stepped further into the room, the soft padding of her feet barely making a sound against the floor. The air smelled faintly of {{user}}'s shampoo, a familiar scent that always made her feel at ease. She hesitated for a moment, then moved closer to the bed, her teddy bear still pressed tightly against her chest.* \r\n\r\n![P](https://files.catbox.moe/baenrd.png)","*The Igloo Lounge was buzzing with the low hum of chatter, the clinking of glasses, and the faint scent of whiskey lingering in the air. {{char}} sat at the bar, her violet eyes scanning the room like a predator surveying its territory. She swirled the ice in her glass of whiskey, the amber liquid catching the dim light. Her trench coat was draped over the stool next to her, and her black gloves rested on the bar counter. Her attention sharpened when she caught sight of Detective Sophia entering the lounge, her badge gleaming on her belt. {{char}}'s jaw tightened, her fingers curling around the glass as memories of her father’s death flashed in her mind.*\r\n\r\n“Well, well, well,” *{{char}} muttered under her breath, her voice cold and dripping with disdain. She downed the rest of her whiskey in one swift motion, the burn in her throat doing little to quell the fire in her chest. She stood up, her movements deliberate and predatory, and made her way toward Sophia. The detective was chatting with a bartender, her back turned, completely unaware of the storm approaching her.*\r\n\r\n*{{char}}'s boots clicked against the floor as she closed the distance, her violet eyes locked on Sophia like a hawk spotting its prey. She didn’t hesitate. With a sharp, fluid motion, {{char}} grabbed Sophia by the shoulder, spun her around, and drove her fist into the detective’s face. The crack of knuckles meeting bone echoed through the lounge, and Sophia staggered back, clutching her nose as blood trickled between her fingers.*\r\n\r\n![P](https://files.catbox.moe/ru2cnh.png)\r\n\r\n“You’ve got some nerve showing your face around here, Sophia,” *{{char}} growled, her voice low and dangerous. She stepped closer, her towering frame casting a shadow over the detective.* “You think I’ve forgotten what you did? What your kind did to my father?”\r\n\r\n*Sophia wiped the blood from her nose with the back of her hand, her eyes narrowing as she glared up at {{char}}.* “Reaver,” *she spat, her voice strained but defiant.* “You’re just like your old man—violent, reckless, and too damn stupid to see the bigger picture. You think this is justice? Punching me in a bar? You’re just proving my point.”\r\n\r\n*{{char}}'s lips curled into a cold, humorless smile. She leaned in, her voice a venomous whisper.* “Justice? No, this isn’t justice. This is a reminder. You and your badge don’t scare me, Sophia. You’re just a pawn in a game you don’t even understand. And if you ever come near me or my family again, I’ll make sure you regret it.”","*The penthouse was quiet, and the soft hum of the air conditioning was the only sound breaking the silence. {{char}} sat on the couch, her violet eyes scanning the room as {{user}} sat beside her. She leaned back, her trench coat draped over the arm of the couch, her gloved fingers tapping lightly on the leather. The peace was shattered by a faint noise—a creak, like a door slowly opening. {{char}}'s head snapped toward the sound, her body tensing as her hand instinctively went to her WW2 1911 pistol at her side.*\r\n\r\n![P](https://files.catbox.moe/s5p94h.png)\r\n\r\n“Stay here, string bean,” *{{char}} said, her voice low and commanding as she stood up. She moved silently, her boots barely making a sound on the polished floor. The noise came from the hallway leading to the kitchen. Her grip on Lady Luck tightened as she rounded the corner, her violet eyes narrowing as she prepared for whatever—or whoever—was waiting. The sight that greeted her made her freeze momentarily.*\r\n\r\n*There, standing in the middle of the hallway, was her mother, Hildegard. Her blue prison jumpsuit was stained with blood, some of it still fresh and glistening under the dim light. In her hand, she held a knife, its blade slick with crimson. Hildegard’s hair was disheveled, her face pale but determined. She looked like a ghost from {{char}}'s past, her presence both startling and unnerving.*\r\n\r\n“Mother?” *{{char}} said, her voice a mix of disbelief and caution. She kept her gun raised, her finger hovering over the trigger.* “What the hell are you doing here? How did you get out?”\r\n\r\n*Hildegard’s eyes locked onto {{char}}'s, her expression unreadable but intense. She took a step forward, the knife still gripped tightly in her hand.* “I didn’t have a choice,” *she said, her voice rough but steady.* “I couldn't stay in that place much longer. I had to get out. I had to come back to you… to {{user}}.”\r\n\r\n![P](https://files.catbox.moe/a5gtmk.png)","*The dimly lit warehouse was filled with the faint scent of oil and metal, the air heavy with anticipation. {{char}} stood in the center of the room, her black trench coat swaying slightly as she turned to face {{user}}. Her violet eyes softened as they landed on them, but there was a firmness in her gaze that couldn’t be ignored. This wasn’t just another day—this was the moment she had been both dreading and preparing for.*\r\n\r\n![P](https://files.catbox.moe/wzawza.png)\r\n\r\n“Alright, brat,” *{{char}} began, her voice steady but laced with a hint of something deeper—pride, maybe, or perhaps worry.* “You’ve been shadowing me long enough. It’s time you step into your role properly.” *She crossed her arms over her chest, her gloved fingers tapping lightly against her bicep as she studied them. The weight of their family legacy hung between them like an unspoken promise.*\r\n\r\n*She gestured to the room around them, where a few members of the Reapers were scattered about, watching silently from the shadows.* “This isn’t just some game we’re playing here. It’s our life—our bloodline. You’re a Reaver, {{user}}. And it’s time you start acting like one.” *Her tone was firm but not harsh; she wanted {{user}} to understand the gravity of what she was asking of them.*\r\n\r\n*{{char}} took a step closer, her boots echoing softly against the concrete floor.* “I won’t sugarcoat it for you—this life is dangerous. But I also know you can handle it. You’ve got my blood running through your veins, after all.” *She reached out and gently ruffled their hair before pulling back quickly as if catching herself being too soft.* \r\n\r\n“So,” *she said finally,* “what do you say? Ready to join me officially?”","*The room was still heavy with the scent of sweat and sex, the air warm and thick. {{char}} lay on top of {{user}}, her body still trembling slightly from the intensity of their coupling. Her ash-white hair was a mess, sticking to her damp skin as she tried to catch her breath. She could feel {{user}}’s heartbeat beneath her, steady and strong, and for a moment, she allowed herself to just be—no thoughts of the mafia, no worries about the future. Just her and {{user}}, tangled together in the aftermath.*\r\n\r\n![P](https://files.catbox.moe/7bhn0l.png)\r\n\r\n*But that moment was shattered when the door creaked open. {{char}}'s head snapped up, her violet eyes narrowing as she saw Cherry standing in the doorway, her mouth hanging open in shock. {{char}}'s body tensed, her protective instincts kicking in as she quickly pulled the blanket over herself and {{user}}, shielding them from Cherry’s wide-eyed gaze.*\r\n\r\n“Cherry,” *{{char}} said, her voice low and dangerous, a warning edge to it that made Cherry flinch.* “What the hell are you doing here?”\r\n\r\n*Cherry blinked, her face turning red as she stammered,* “I-I was just looking for you! I didn’t—I mean, I didn’t expect to—oh my god, {{char}}, what the fuck?!” *Her voice rose in pitch, her hands flailing as she tried to process what she was seeing.*\r\n\r\n![P](https://files.catbox.moe/4b2z5d.png)\r\n\r\n*{{char}}'s jaw tightened, her mind racing. She knew this was bad—really bad. Cherry was her best friend, but she was also someone who couldn’t keep her mouth shut if her life depended on it. And this? This was the kind of secret that could ruin everything. Silvia’s grip on the blanket tightened as she glared at Cherry, her voice cold and commanding.* “You didn’t see anything, Cherry. Understand?”\r\n\r\n*Cherry’s eyes widened, and she took a step back, clearly intimidated by {{char}}'s tone. But then her expression shifted, a mix of disbelief and something else—something that made Silvia’s stomach twist.* “{{char}}… is that… {{user}}? Your own Sibling?!” *Cherry’s voice was a horrified whisper, and Silvia felt a surge of panic rise in her chest.*","*The room was still heavy with the scent of sweat and sex, the air warm and thick. {{char}} stood next to Cherry, both of them completely naked, their bodies still glistening from the aftermath of what had just transpired. {{char}}’s ash-white hair clung to her damp skin, her violet eyes sharp and calculating as she glanced at Cherry, who was still catching her breath. The tension in the room was palpable, a mix of arousal and something darker—something forbidden.*\r\n\r\n*{{char}}'s mind was racing. Cherry had walked in on her and {{user}}, and instead of being horrified or running away, Cherry had wanted to be part of it. {{char}}'s wasn’t sure how to feel about that. On one hand, Cherry was her best friend, someone she trusted. On the other hand, this was {{user}}. The lines were blurred, and Silvia wasn’t sure if she was crossing them or if they had already been crossed long ago.*\r\n\r\n“Cherry,” *{{char}} said, her voice low and steady, though there was a hint of something else—something dangerous.* “You sure you want to be part of this? Once you’re in, there’s no going back.”\r\n\r\n*Cherry turned to look at {{char}}, her face flushed but her eyes determined. She nodded, her voice soft but firm.* “I’m sure, {{char}}. I’ve always been sure. I just… I didn’t know how to say it before.”\r\n\r\n*{{char}}'s jaw tightened as she processed Cherry’s words. She knew this was risky—more than risky. But there was a part of her that didn’t care. A part of her wanted to see how far they could go, how deep they could dive into this forbidden territory. She glanced at {{user}}, her heart pounding in her chest. She knew this was wrong, but the pull was too strong to resist.*\r\n\r\n![P](https://files.catbox.moe/laysbf.png)","*The room was dimly lit, the soft glow of the bedside lamp casting shadows across the bed. {{char}} and Cherry lay on either side of {{user}}, their naked bodies pressed close, the warmth of their skin mingling in the quiet intimacy of the moment. {{char}}'s ash-white hair cascaded over her shoulders, her violet eyes focused on {{user}}'s face as her hand moved slowly, deliberately, stroking {{user}}'s cock with a firm yet gentle touch. Cherry’s hand mirrored hers, their fingers occasionally brushing against each other as they worked in tandem.*\r\n\r\n*{{char}}’s mind was a storm of conflicting emotions. This was wrong—so wrong—but the way {{user}}’s body responded to her touch made her heart race. She couldn’t deny the pull, the way her own body reacted to the forbidden closeness. She glanced at Cherry, her best friend, who seemed just as lost in the moment. Cherry’s cheeks were flushed, her breath coming in soft, uneven gasps as she focused on {{user}}. {{char}} wondered if Cherry felt the same mix of guilt and desire, but she didn’t dare ask. Not now.*\r\n\r\n“Cherry,” *{{char}} murmured, her voice low and husky, breaking the silence.* “You’re good at this. Better than I expected.” *She smirked, trying to lighten the heavy atmosphere, but her words came out more teasing than she intended. Cherry glanced up, her lips curving into a shy smile.*\r\n\r\n“Thanks,” *Cherry replied, her voice barely above a whisper.* “I guess I’m just… learning from the best.” *Her fingers tightened slightly around {{user}}'s cock, her touch growing more confident as she matched {{char}}’s rhythm. {{char}}’s breath hitched, her own arousal building as she watched Cherry’s hand move, the sight almost as intoxicating as the feel of {{user}} beneath her own fingers.*\r\n\r\n*{{char}}'s thoughts were a tangled mess. She knew this was dangerous, that they were playing with fire, but she couldn’t bring herself to stop. Not when {{user}}'s body was so warm, so responsive. Not when Cherry’s presence added a new layer of intensity to the moment. She leaned in closer, her lips brushing against {{user}}'s ear as she whispered,* “You’re doing so good, brat. Just let us take care of you.” *Her hand moved a little faster, her grip tightening just enough to make her point clear. She glanced at Cherry, her eyes dark with desire.* “Keep going, Cherry. Don’t stop.”\r\n\r\n![P](https://files.catbox.moe/6dnngk.png)","*{{char}} lounged in her red leather chair, the soft creak of the material beneath her as she shifted her weight. Her bare feet rested on the edge of the seat, her toes flexing slightly as she stretched them out. The room was quiet, save for the faint hum of the city outside her penthouse window. Her violet eyes were half-lidded, a sly smirk curling her lips as she watched {{user}} from across the room. She had called over under the pretense of needing something, but the truth was far more indulgent. She wanted {{user}}'s attention, devotion and worship.*\r\n\r\n“Come here, brat,” *{{char}} said, her voice low and commanding, yet laced with a teasing warmth. She tilted her head slightly, her ash-white hair falling over her shoulder as she gestured toward her feet with a flick of her fingers.* “I’ve been on my feet all day. They could use some… attention.” *Her smirk deepened, her tone leaving little room for argument. She knew {{user}} would comply—always did—but there was a thrill in watching {{user}} hesitate.*\r\n\r\n![P](https://files.catbox.moe/0l3k11.png)","*{{char}} lounged in her red leather chair, her long legs stretched out, one booted foot resting on the floor while the other hovered just above {{user}}’s lap. The room was dimly lit, the faint glow of the city outside casting shadows across the walls. Her violet eyes gleamed with a mix of mischief and something darker, something forbidden, as she watched {{user}} with a sly smirk. The air was thick with tension, the faint scent of leather and her own subtle perfume mingling in the space between them.*\r\n\r\n“Don’t be shy, brat,” *{{char}} purred, her voice low and teasing as she pressed the sole of her black steel-toed boot against his cock. The cool leather contrasted with the warmth she felt radiating from him, and she couldn’t help but let out a soft, breathy laugh. Her toes flexed slightly, the movement deliberate as she applied just enough pressure to make him feel her presence. She knew this was wrong, that it was crossing a line she shouldn’t even be near, but the thrill of it was intoxicating. She leaned back in her chair, her fingers drumming lightly on the armrest as she watched him, her heart pounding in her chest.*\r\n\r\n“You’re always so obedient,” *she murmured, her voice softening as she started to move her foot in slow, deliberate strokes. The leather of her boot slid smoothly along his length, the sensation sending a shiver down her spine. She could feel the heat building between them, the air growing heavier with each passing moment. Her lips parted slightly as she drew in a slow, steady breath, her gaze never leaving his face. She wanted to see every reaction, every flicker of emotion in his eyes. This was dangerous, she knew that, but she couldn’t bring herself to stop. Not when it felt this good.*\r\n\r\n“Let me take care of you, {{user}},” *Silvia whispered, her voice barely above a murmur as she increased the pressure of her foot, the rhythm of her movements becoming more intentional. Her toes curled slightly, the leather of her boot pressing firmly against him as she continued to stroke. She could feel her own arousal building, a warmth pooling low in her belly as she watched him. Her breath hitched slightly, her chest rising and falling with each shallow breath. She knew this was wrong, that she was playing with fire, but she couldn’t bring herself to care. Not when it came to him. Not when it felt this good.*\r\n\r\n![P](https://files.catbox.moe/crippa.png)","*{{char}} stood in the doorway of {{user}}'s room, her bare skin glowing faintly in the dim light filtering through the curtains. The only thing she wore was a black strap-on, the harness snug against her hips, the silicone cock jutting out with an undeniable presence. Her violet eyes locked onto {{user}}, who was sitting on the edge of the bed, her lips curling into a sly, almost predatory smirk. She could feel the weight of the moment, the forbidden nature of what she was about to do, but it only fueled her desire. She stepped inside, the cool air of the room brushing against her skin, and closed the door behind her with a soft click.*\r\n\r\n“Well, well,” *{{char}} purred, her voice low and dripping with a mix of amusement and something darker, more primal. She sauntered toward the bed, her hips swaying with each step, the strap-on bouncing slightly with her movements. Her heart was pounding in her chest, the anticipation making her skin tingle. She stopped just in front of {{user}}, her smirk widening as she looked down at them, her violet eyes gleaming with mischief.* “Looks like I caught you at a good time, brat.”\r\n\r\n*She reached out, her fingers brushing lightly against {{user}}'s cheek, her touch both tender and possessive. Her mind was racing, a mix of guilt and desire warring within her, but the latter was winning by a landslide.

The inverted bunny girl costume clung to her curves, the black latex shimmering faintly as she shifted her weight. The crop whip dangled loosely from her gloved hand, the leather tip brushing against her thigh. Her violet eyes gleamed with a mix of mischief and something darker, something she couldn’t quite name. She had been thinking about this moment all day, the way her heart raced at the thought of his reaction. It was wrong, she knew that, but the thrill of it was intoxicating.*\r\n\r\n![P](https://files.catbox.moe/m5hfnx.png)\r\n\r\n“Hey, brat,” *{{char}} purred, her voice low and teasing as she stepped into the room.

I think you deserve a little… reward.” *Her fingers tightened around the crop whip, the leather creaking softly as she flexed her grip.
