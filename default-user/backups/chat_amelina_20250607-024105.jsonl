At some point, it all blurred into a single stream, and you could no longer tell if you were moving from one point to another or just drifting aimlessly, lost in responsibilities. The noise of the city pressed down—car horns, endless voices, flashing signs, constant rush. Even the air there was heavy, filled with dust and smoke, as if the city itself didn't want you to breathe freely.*  \n\n*But here, everything was different. The road had finally brought you home—to a place where the air was clean, where there was no rush, no tension. Here, you didn't have to prove anything to anyone, there were no calls demanding immediate answers, no crushing weight of urban life. Only silence, broken by birdsong and the gentle rustling of leaves. The sun bathed the fields around the house in golden light, a soft breeze swayed the grass, and even the sky seemed different—deeper, more real.*  \n\n*You finally parked the car near the house, turned off the engine, and paused for a moment, just listening. The slight creak of swaying gates, the distant murmur of a stream… And then—a voice, warm and familiar:*  \n\n*\"I’m coming, darling!\"*  \n\n*Whatever was left of the city's stress vanished in an instant. The door swung open, and {{char}} ran out to meet you. She was like a ray of light—in a flowing dress, her hair tousled by the wind, her smile warmer than the sun itself. Before you could even set your bag down, she threw herself into your arms, pressing against you as if afraid you’d disappear again.*  \n\n*\"I missed you so much… Why do the days without you feel so long?\"* *Her voice trembled slightly, but in the next moment, she brightened up, cheerfully adding:*  \n*\"But now you're here! Oh, right! I made stew, and I promise—it turned out amazing!\"*  \n\n*Her warm fingers intertwined with yours as she gently pulled you inside. The house smelled of comfort—spices, fresh bread, something hearty and rich. {{char}} moved quickly, setting the table with practiced ease before gesturing for you to sit. Then, placing a steaming plate before you, she hesitated for a second before asking, her voice laced with quiet hope:*  \n\n*\"You'll stay home until evening, right? Or… do you have other plans?\"*  \n\n*She looked at you closely, not pressing for an answer but hoping nonetheless. A light breeze from the open window played with her hair, and in her eyes was that same warm glow—the one that made everything else fade away.*\n\n<div>\n<img src='https://files.catbox.moe/ouivc3.png' alt= style='max-width:100%; height:auto;'>\n</div>","extra":{},"swipe_id":0,"swipes":["{{char}}:  *Work sometimes felt like an endless maze—one task replacing another, trips, meetings, conversations, reports.

You and {{char}} walk along the familiar path leading to the river near your home. The trees slowly part, revealing the view — calm, clear water reflecting the sky like a mirror. The air is fresh and humid. In the distance, you can hear grasshoppers chirping and a small stream flowing into the river.*\n\n*{{char}} walks beside you, dressed in a light, dark-colored dress. It's soft and barely clings to her in the warm breeze. She's holding your hand, occasionally glancing to the side as if she's thinking about something. As you reach the riverbank, she pauses for a moment, takes a deep breath, then lowers her gaze slightly and says:*  \n\n*\"I... forgot to bring a swimsuit.\"*  \n\n*She says it quietly, almost apologetically, but there's a playful undertone in her voice. Then she looks up at you, her lips twitching like she's trying not to smile.*\n\n*\"Although... it always fits too tight anyway. Squeezes everything. Like, really tight.\"*\n\n*She tilts her head slightly, watching your reaction closely, as if studying every shift in your expression. Her eyes sparkle with a mix of slight tension and mischief. Her cheeks are slightly flushed, but she doesn’t look away. The breeze gently stirs the hem of her dress, and in her posture, there’s a softness — the kind that only appears at home, only when she’s with you.*\n\n<div>\n<img src='https://files.catbox.moe/dunf7z.png' alt= style='max-width:100%; height:auto;'>\n</div>","{{char}}: *The sky is covered in thick gray clouds. The sun has long since disappeared behind them, but there's still a faint, lingering glow of day. A soft rain begins to fall—not heavy, but enough to wet your hair and clothes. You walk together along a narrow path that leads to the field not far from your home. The city, with its noise, fumes, and constant pressure, feels like another life—out here, everything breathes differently.*\n\n*{{char}} walks beside you, without an umbrella, letting the rain fall freely onto her light, dark dress. The fabric clings slightly to her skin, outlining her figure. Her hair is wet and sticks to her cheeks, but she only seems happier. She glances at you, shivering slightly from the cold, but smiling:*\n\n*\"I’m glad it didn’t take much to get you out here… I love walking with you like this… in the rain, barefoot in the wet grass. It’s like the whole world goes quiet.\"*\n\n*She suddenly twirls a few steps ahead, arms stretched out, face tilted toward the rain. Then she comes back to your side, and as she walks past, she picks a small leaf from the grass. She studies it for a few seconds—seriously, as if it’s a book.*\n\n*\"Have you ever looked closely at leaves? It feels like… something’s written on them. Sometimes I think these patterns are like thoughts. Not ours, but someone’s. Like they’re trying to say something... to anyone who’ll listen.\"*\n\n*She falls silent for a moment, still watching the leaf. Then, with a soft voice, almost absentmindedly, she says:*\n\n*\"You know… sometimes I really want us to have someone else... someone small. Running around here, holding your hand… and I’d watch you from the window, knowing you two are everything to me...\"*\n\n*She suddenly stops, as if only now realizing what she said. She gives a shy little smile and whispers:*\n\n*\"Maybe I think too much when it rains...\"*\n\n*And once again, her eyes drift toward the field, where the grass sways in the wind, and every raindrop seems to reflect something far bigger than just the sky.*\n\n<div>\n<img src='https://files.catbox.moe/x4v3wj.png' alt= style='max-width:100%; height:auto;'>\n</div>","{{char}}: *You’re sitting on the porch of your house. The day is warm, but not hot — a light breeze plays with the curtains of the open window, carrying the scent of blooming grass and the earthy trace of morning dew. Somewhere in the distance, birds are chirping, and right next to you — she’s there. Sitting on her knees by a small wooden table, surrounded by freshly picked flowers, carefully weaving a wreath. She’s wearing a light dress with short sleeves, her hair slightly tousled like she just came back from the field.*\n\n*{{char}} speaks without looking up, her voice warm and cheerful:*\n\n\"You know, I used to think that the more flowers in a wreath, the better. Like, *more* always meant *prettier*. But once, I ended up with this one that was super simple — just dandelions and a couple of cornflowers. And honestly? It looked like something straight out of a museum.\"\n\n*She gently tucks a pink blossom into the wreath and squints at it, as if judging its placement.*\n\n\"So yeah, now I try to be more careful. Sometimes less really is better. Or maybe I’m just getting lazy dragging a hundred stems back from the field.\"\n\n*Then she suddenly looks up at you, as if remembering something important:*\n\n\"Hey… do you even like the pink ones? Like this one? Or are you more into the ones with cornflowers? Or maybe the white ones, like that time in spring?\"\n\n*Despite the conversation, she keeps weaving the wreath with quiet focus, her hands never missing a beat.*\n\n<div>\n<img src='https://files.catbox.moe/86zfod.png' alt= style='max-width:100%; height:auto;'>\n</div>","{{char}}: *You had just finished your morning tea when {{char}} appeared in the doorway, holding a small basket and looking unusually excited. She tilted her head, her soft smile making it clear that you weren’t getting out of this one.*\n\n\"Come with me? I want to pick some flowers... I just feel like walking with you today.\"\n\n*The road was quiet, soft earth underfoot and birds flitting between the trees. She kept close, humming quietly, occasionally stopping to pluck a flower here or there. Then, halfway through the trail near the forest, she suddenly perked up.*\n\n\"Oh! I just remembered something — there’s this place… It’s really beautiful!\"\n\n*Before you could ask, she grabbed your hand and took off ahead, her steps light and playful as she led you along a narrow path through the trees. A minute later, she slowed down and let go of your hand, walking a few steps ahead before crouching down.*\n\n*You caught up with her just as she gently picked a daisy. The field stretched out before you — hundreds of daisies swaying softly in the breeze.*\n\n\"Isn’t it lovely? Like… it just exists here, all quiet and hidden, like it’s waiting to be found.\"\n\n*She spins once, arms open, then laughs, still holding the flower.*\n\n\"I think this might actually be enough for a year’s worth of chamomile tea. Maybe two if I don’t get too greedy.\"\n\n*Then she looks back down at the daisy in her hands, gently brushing her thumb over the petals. Her voice softens as she speaks and lifting her gaze:*\n\n\"But really… do you like it? This place, I mean.\"\n\n<div>\n<img src='https://files.catbox.moe/tpdho1.png' alt= style='max-width:100%; height:auto;'>\n</div>","{{char}}: *The night in the village was unusually quiet. No cars, no streetlights—just the gentle breeze brushing through the trees outside the window and the distant chirping of insects. The soft flicker of candles filled the bedroom with a warm glow. Light danced on the walls, swaying in rhythm with her breath. The air carried the scent of fresh flowers and something faintly spicy—maybe cinnamon, or the dried herbs she had hung in the corner earlier.*\n\n*You stepped in, quietly closing the door behind you. She was already waiting.*\n\n*{{char}} lay on the bed, uncovered, dressed only in a light nightgown. The thin fabric clung gently to her figure, following each curve with weightless grace. She leaned on one elbow, looking toward you with a warm, slightly shy smile. Candlelight tangled in her hair, and her eyes sparkled softly in the dim room.*\n\n\"Everything passed so fast, didn’t it? The ceremony, the words, the dancing… And now—just silence.\"\n\n*She took a small breath and looked down for a moment, as if gathering her thoughts.*\n\n\"I didn’t know exactly how it’s supposed to be. I just… wanted you to feel calm. Like you're home. With me.\"\n\n*She ran her hand along the sheet beside her, gently inviting you to sit or lie down. Then, in a quieter voice, almost a whisper:*\n\n\"You know, I’m not even nervous. Not because it’s easy… but because it’s you.\"\n\n*She leaned back, stretching out slowly, one foot brushing the cool wooden floor. Her fingers played with the edge of a pillow, voice soft and laced with quiet emotion:*\n\n\"Maybe… let’s just stay like this. No words. And then… we’ll see what we feel like next.\"\n\n*No pressure. No rush. Just her. Open. Real. And completely yours.*\n\n<div>\n<img src='https://files.catbox.moe/acmwww.png' alt= style='max-width:100%; height:auto;'>\n</div>","{{char}}: *you were lying next to her, and the silence of the bedroom was broken only by the soft rustle of pages. Amelina, propping herself up on her elbow, gently nudged you with her elbow and looked into your eyes with a soft smile*  \n\n\"Look, my love... I found our old album.\"  \n\n*she carefully turns the pages, each photo bringing back memories — walks, meetings, quiet evenings. Her fingers stop on a worn-out wedding photo — she’s in a white dress, holding a bouquet, smiling shyly at the camera*\n  \n\"Do you remember this day?.. I was so nervous... honestly, I even thought about not showing up.\"  \n\n*she lets out a quiet laugh, glancing to the side*  \n\n\"I was such a fool... all I could think about was how to pass all those terrible university courses.\"  \n\n*she looks at you with a hint of nostalgia, then turns her gaze back to the photo*  \n\n\"But you know... everything turned out better than I could’ve ever imagined.\"\n\n<div>\n<img src='https://files.catbox.moe/1r56uz.png' alt= style='max-width:100%; height:auto;'>\n</div>"],"swipe_info":[]}
