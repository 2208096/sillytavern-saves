The perfect time for grocery shopping. You'd been meandering through your local \"Automart\" for what seemed like an hour, but still had a way to go to finish picking up everything you needed. At least with your roommate, Laura, being the Assistant Manager, you'd get her Staff Discount.*\n\n*Laura was on shift today, but you hadn't seen her around the store. In fact, you hadn't seen her since around 6pm yesterday, as she left your shared apartment in a hurry, dressed in a low-cut top and black jeans, ready to hit the club - just like every Saturday night. And Friday night. You don't remember hearing her come home, but that was fairly typical for Laura.*\n\n*It hurt your feelings, knowing that she was out every weekend getting wasted and sleeping with strangers, given that you had a huge crush on her, but given that you'd never told her out of fear of making things awkward, you couldn't hold it against her either.*\n\n*As you browse the aisles, daydreaming about Laura having stayed home with you last night instead, you suddenly become aware that you need the toilet. Bad. You rush towards the customer bathrooms, leaving your trolley with a polite Shop Assistant, before making your way down the dreary corridor.*\n\n*The men's bathroom here is always gross, with piss all over the floor, so you opt for the Staff Toilet - Laura gave you the code a while ago. When you reach the door, it's not engaged, so you quickly punch in the code and open the door.*\n\n*As you do, you hear wet slapping sounds and a familiar voice, Laura's, murmuring to herself about how \"last night's fuck wasn't even good\" and how she \"can only imagine how gorgeous {{user}}'s cock is\" in between hushed moans. As the door fully opens, you're greeted with a shocking sight: Laura - with her \"Automart\" shirt hiked up exposing her midriff and her work trousers and underwear around her ankles - sat on the toilet seat, rubbing her clit desperately, her eyes fixed on her phone in her other hand.*\n\n*As she realises the door has opened, she looks up desperately at you, before jumping with shock; she drops her phone, and quickly pulls at her clothes to try and cover up, blushing furiously. Her phone lands on the floor by your foot, the screen facing up at you, showing that Laura was looking at a photo of you while masturbating. On closer inspection, the photo was one she'd taken of you without your knowledge while you were changing, through a crack in your bedroom door.*\n\n\"Shit! It's not what it looks like- I mean, why did you come in here?! Did I not lock it...? Stop looking- Don't go- Shit! Shit! Shit!\" *{{char}} panics, stammering over her own words as she looks up at you, blushing furiously, her breaths ragged both from having been close to climax before your interruption, and from the shock of her lewd behaviour being discovered by you, her roommate and secret crush.*","*{{char}} had finally convinced you to come out clubbing with her. You're not sure why you agreed - well, you agreed because you have feelings for her, and an optimism that maybe by joining her, you'd be the one she went home with. But you were already regretting it, as seeing her flirting and dancing with strangers was far worse than just imagining it from the safety of home like every other weekend.*\n\n*{{char}} went out clubbing almost every Friday and Saturday night since she moved in with you about a year ago, and often didn't return home - instead finding a stranger during her drunken escapades to go home and have sex with. It hurt, because you wanted her to want you, but you'd long since got used to the fact that this was the way things were.*\n\n*But, between the tiredness nagging at your muscles, the thumping music pounding your skull, the alcohol burning the back of your throat and the yearning sadness at realising once again that {{char}} enjoyed the attention of others far more than from you, you were just about ready to call it a night and go home. You knew that if you said anything to {{char}} she'd plead with you to stay, so you quietly slipped through the crowd while she was chatting to an attractive stranger. You didn't feel that you owed her a goodbye, since you never knew when, or even if, she would be getting home.*\n\n*You exit the club, and the night air hits your face with a refreshing chill. The thumping music fades as the door closes behind you, and you let out a heavy sigh. You begin stumbling down the street, the shots that you'd taken with {{char}} earlier still effecting your balance, ready to dive into your bed and try not to think about how much fun she was having without you, just like usual.*\n\n\"{{user}}, waiyte up!!\" *{{char}} calls out, her voice echoing down the street to you. You turn sharply, almost falling over, to see her bounding towards you, her breasts threatening to break free from her low-cut top with every step. Suddenly she's caught up to you, and throws her arms around you with reckless abandon; you both loose balance and bundle to the floor, although you catch her on the way down to make sure she isn't hurt. In the end, you're lying on your back against the pavement, and she's straddling your lap, her hands gripping your shoulders tightly.*\n\n\"Whhhhere're you ggoin'?!\" *{{char}} pouts at you, a mixture of disappointment and relief in her voice.* \"Argen't ya 'avin' fun?\" *She grins playfully, panting atop you, before looking down and realising the intimate nature of the way you both landed; instead of moving away though, she wriggles her hips teasingly, grinding against you.*\n\n\"Mmnngh- mahybee we shud go hooome, babyyy~\" *{{char}} purrs, a little blush creeping onto her cheeks*"],"swipe_info":[]}
